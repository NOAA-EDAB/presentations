	abstract = {The state-space model framework provides a natural, probabilistic approach to stock assessment by modeling the stochastic nature of population survival and recruitment separately from sampling uncertainty inherent in observations on the population. We propose a state-space assessment model that is expanded to simultaneously treat environmental covariates as stochastic processes and estimate their effects on recruitment. We apply the model to southern New England yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) using data from the most recent benchmark assessment to evaluate evidence for effects of the mid-Atlantic cold pool and spawning stock biomass on recruitment. Based on Akaike’s information criterion, both the cold pool and spawning stock biomass were important predictors of recruitment and led to annual variation in estimated biomass reference points and associated yield. We also demonstrate the effect of the stochasticity of the mid-Atlantic cold pool on short-term forecasts of the stock size, biomass reference point, and stock status.},

Defining trends and thresholds in responses of ecological indicators to fishing and environmental pressures. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 755–767. Both fishing and environmental forces can influence the structure of marine ecosystems. To further understand marine ecosystems and to implement ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), an evaluation of ecosystem indicators is warranted. In this context, it is particularly important to identify thresholds where fishing and environmental pressures significantly influence ecological indicators. We empirically determined numerical values of environmental forces and fishing pressure that significantly altered the response of ecological indicators for the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Generalized additive models predicted a non-linear relationship for each pressure–response pairing. With this smoother, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for estimated first and second derivatives for each relationship were determined via parametric bootstrap. A significant trend or threshold was noted when the CI for the first or second derivative was greater or less than zero, delineating the level at which pressure variables influence the rate and direction of ecosystem indicator responses. We identify reference levels where environmental forces and fishing pressure result in ecosystem change by collectively examining the responses of multiple ecological indicators. Individual indicators showed unique responses to pressures, however, similar values for the pressures were associated with significant changes for multiple indicators. These reference levels establish a foundation for implementation of EBFM.},

We used Management Strategy Evaluation to test the performance of control rules that used ecological indicators to adjust the advice from single-species stock assessments, using the Georges Bank finfish fishery as a case study. We compare the performance of control rules that used ecological indicators to that of single-species FMSY control rules when the system dynamics were governed by the same multispecies population model. Control rules that used indicator-based reference points were able to perform better against catch and biodiversity objectives than when harvests were based on single-species advice alone. Indicators and values for reference points associated with good performance varied depending on the management objective. We quantified tradeoffs between total catch, biodiversity, and interannual variability in catch, noting that it was possible in some instances to achieve higher than average biodiversity while maintaining high catches using indicator-based control rules. While improved performance was noted using ecological indicators, outcomes were variable, and the gains in performance obtained may be similar to alternative methods of implementing precaution in single-species fishery control rules.},

	abstract = {Successful implementation of Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) requires practical methods of translating information on system status into management actions. Threshold values in ecosystem indicators have been demonstrated to provide insight for characterizing change points in marine ecosystems and suggested as reference points for EBFM. We used a guild based multispecies simulation model of the Georges Bank finfish community to quantify tradeoffs and changes among values for proposed ecological indicators given alternative fishing scenarios, and tested the performance of indicator-based approaches for setting system ceilings on annual catches. Values for ecosystem indicators were sensitive to the exploitation rates on guilds, with total biomass of the community being most sensitive to groundfish exploitation rate. Setting ceilings on system-wide annual catches was successful in constraining values for indicators and revealed levels of system catch associated with indicator change. Community composition indicators showed catch thresholds lower than provided by the total biomass indicator. Ceilings based on community composition indicators more frequently resulted in higher yields and fewer species being overfished than when ceilings were set using total biomass or when no ceiling was in place. Simulations demonstrated that threshold values in ecosystem indicators could be used to determine reference points in an EBFM context. The broad ranges for threshold values obtained demonstrates the sensitivity of such methods to exploitation history, underscoring the need to both incorporate expert knowledge and relate reference point determination to management objectives.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) in marine ecosystems considers impacts caused by complex interactions between environmental and anthropogenic pressures (i.e. oceanographic, climatic, socio-economic) and marine communities. EBM depends, in part, on ecological indicators that facilitate understanding of inherent properties and the dynamics of pressures within marine communities. Thresholds of ecological indicators delineate ecosystem status because they represent points at which a small increase in one or many pressure variables results in an abrupt change of ecosystem responses. The difficulty in developing appropriate thresholds and reference points for EBM lies in the multidimensionality of both the ecosystem responses and the pressures impacting the ecosystem. Here, we develop thresholds using gradient forest for a suite of ecological indicators in response to multiple pressures that convey ecosystem status for large marine ecosystems from the US Pacific, Atlantic, sub-Arctic, and Gulf of Mexico. We detected these thresholds of ecological indicators based on multiple pressures. Commercial fisheries landings above approximately 2-4.5 t km-2 and fisheries exploitation above 20-40\% of the total estimated biomass (of invertebrates and fish) of the ecosystem resulted in a change in the direction of ecosystem structure and functioning in the ecosystems examined. Our comparative findings reveal common trends in ecosystem thresholds along pressure gradients and also indicate that thresholds of ecological indicators are useful tools for comparing the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic pressures across multiple ecosystems. These critical points can be used to inform the development of EBM decision criteria.},

That focus has intensified with shifting environmental conditions associated with accelerating climate change. The U.S. Northeast Shelf (NES) is a well-studied continental shelf marine ecosystem that is among the more rapidly warming marine systems worldwide. Furthermore, many constituent species have experienced significant distributional shifts. However, the system response of the NES to climate change goes beyond simple shifts in species distribution. The fish and macroinvertebrate communities of the NES have increased in species diversity and overall productivity in recent decades, despite no significant decline in fishing pressure. Species distribution models constructed using random forest classification and regression trees were fit for the dominant species in the system. Over time, the areal distribution of occupancy habitat has increased for approximately 80\% of the modeled taxa, suggesting most species have significantly increased their range and niche space. These niche spaces were analyzed to determine the area of niche overlap between species pairs. For the vast majority of species pairs, interaction has increased over time suggesting greater niche overlap and the increased probability for more intense species interactions, such as between competitors or predators and prey. Furthermore, the species taxonomic composition and size structure indicate a potential tropicalization of the fish community. The system and community changes are consistent with the view that the NES may be transitioning from a cold temperate or boreal ecoregion to one more consistent with the composition of a warm temperate or Carolinian system.},

	abstract = {The ability to understand and ultimately predict ecosystem response to multiple pressures is paramount to successfully implement ecosystem-based management. Thresholds shifts and nonlinear patterns in ecosystem responses can be used to determine reference points that identify levels of a pressure that may drastically alter ecosystem status, which can inform management action. However, quantifying ecosystem reference points has proven elusive due in large part to the multi-dimensional nature of both ecosystem pressures and ecosystem responses. We used ecological indicators, synthetic measures of ecosystem status and functioning, to enumerate important ecosystem attributes and to reduce the complexity of the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME). Random forests were used to quantify the importance of four environmental and four anthropogenic pressure variables to the value of ecological indicators, and to quantify shifts in aggregate ecological indicator response along pressure gradients. Anthropogenic pressure variables were critical defining features and were able to predict an average of 8-13\% (up to 25-66\% for individual ecological indicators) of the variation in ecological indicator values, whereas environmental pressures were able to predict an average of 1-5 \% (up to 9-26\% for individual ecological indicators) of ecological indicator variation. Each pressure variable predicted a different suite of ecological indicator's variation and the shapes of ecological indicator responses along pressure gradients were generally nonlinear. Threshold shifts in ecosystem response to exploitation, the most important pressure variable, occurred when commercial landings were 20 and 60\% of total surveyed biomass. Although present, threshold shifts in ecosystem response to environmental pressures were much less important, which suggests that anthropogenic pressures have significantly altered the ecosystem structure and functioning of the NES LME. Gradient response curves provide ecologically informed transformations of pressure variables to explain patterns of ecosystem structure and functioning. By concurrently identifying thresholds for a suite of ecological indicator responses to multiple pressures, we demonstrate that ecosystem reference points can be evaluated and used to support ecosystem-based management.},

	abstract = {The application of ecosystem considerations, and in particular ecosystem report cards, in federal groundfish fisheries management in Alaska can be described as an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Ecosystem information is provided to managers to establish an ecosystem context within which deliberations of fisheries quota occur. Our goal is to make the case for the need for qualitative ecosystem assessments in EAFM, specifically that qualitative synthesis has advantages worthy to keep a permanent place at the fisheries management table. These advantages include flexibility and speed in responding to and synthesizing new information from a variety of sources. First, we use the development of indicator-based ecosystem report cards as an example of adapting ecosystem information to management needs. Second, we review lessons learned and provide suggestions for best practices for applying EAFM to large and diverse fisheries in multiple marine ecosystems. Adapting ecosystem indicator information to better suit the needs of fisheries managers resulted in succinct report cards that summarize ecosystem trends, complementing more detailed ecosystem information to provide context for EAFM. There were several lessons learned in the process of developing the ecosystem report cards. The selection of indicators for each region was influenced by geography, the extent of scientific knowledge/data, and the particular expertise of the selection teams. Optimizing the opportunity to qualitatively incorporate ecosystem information into management decisions requires a good understanding of the management system in question. We found that frequent dialogue with managers and other stakeholders leads to adaptive products. We believe that there will always be a need for qualitative ecosystem assessment because it allows for rapid incorporation of new ideas and data and unexpected events. As we build modelling and predictive capacity, we will still need qualitative synthesis to capture events outside the bounds of current models and to detect impacts of the unexpected.},

Shifts early in the time series generally reﬂected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identiﬁed in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identiﬁed in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratiﬁcation, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.},

	abstract = {The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends, all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed sufficiently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to define ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses identified the existence of threshold responses of five ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and habitat modification, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer mode of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively, however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as five of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers, groundfish, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea that the influence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by defining the nonlinear nature of these responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.},

	abstract = {The well-documented value of marine fisheries is threatened by overfishing. Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50\% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.
Newly derived thresholds show that about half the world’s marine ecosystems are experiencing “ecosystem” overfishing.

	abstract = {This paper develops a risk table to facilitate incorporation of additional information into the fisheries stock assessment and management process. The risk table is designed to evaluate unanticipated ecosystem and environmental impacts on marine resources that may require a rapid management response. The risk table is a standardized framework to document concerns about the assessment model, population dynamics, and the ecosystem/environment that are not explicitly addressed within the stock assessment model. A scoring procedure is used to evaluate the severity of the concern. These concerns can then be evaluated in support for or against a reduction from the maximum Acceptable Biological Catch while providing reviewers and stakeholders transparent documentation of the concerns. The risk table was applied successfully to several stocks on a trial basis during the 2018 groundfish assessment cycle for the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, and will be used for all full groundfish assessments in 2019. Rapid changes in climate are likely for Alaska marine ecosystems in coming decades, and these changes are not entirely predicable. Therefore, we avocate that the risk table approach should be included in the suite of management tools used to address the effects of climate change on Alaska marine resources.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are characterized by many complex interactions. Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change. In the final section, we outline an example to illustrate how a structured decision making process within the framework could work.},

	abstract = {Fishery managers worldwide are evaluating methods for incorporating climate, habitat, ecological, social, and economic factors into current operations in order to implement Ecosystem Approaches to Fishery Management (EAFM). While this can seem overwhelming, it is possible to take practical steps towards EAFM implementation that make use of existing information and provide managers with valuable strategic advice. Here, we describe the process used by the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop an ecosystem-level risk assessment, the initial step proposed in their recently adopted EAFM guidance document. The Council first defined five types of Risk Elements (ecological, economic, social, food production, management) and identified which management objectives aligned with each element. Based on an existing ecosystem status report for the region and other existing sources (including expert opinion), potential ecological, social, economic, and management indicators were identified for each risk element. Finally, low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk criteria were defined for each indicator, and the indicator data were used to score each risk element using the criteria. The ultimate outcome is a ranked risk assessment in order to focus on the highest risk issues for further evaluation and mitigation. The risk assessment highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting Council management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors. Tabular color coded summaries of risk assessment results will be used by the Council to prioritize further EAFM analyses as well as research plans over the coming five years. As ecosystem reporting and operational EAFM continue to evolve in future years, the Council foresees integrating these efforts so that ecosystem indicators are refined to meet the needs of fishery managers in identifying and managing risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives. Overall, ecosystem indicator-based risk assessment is a method that can be adapted to a wide range of resource management systems and available information, and therefore represent a promising way forward in the implementation of EAFM.},

Through the course of 2019, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council developed a conceptual model of ecosystem linkages and risks for summer flounder, a species of recreational and commercial fisheries importance. The proximal aim of the model was to develop a list of integrated management questions that could be refined and addressed through a future quantitative management strategy evaluation. As such, this conceptual model served as a scoping tool. However, the true value of the conceptual model lays elsewhere: familiarizing resource managers historically focused on single-species management with the potential utility of an ecosystem approach to management. This paper details the goals and development of the conceptual model and situates this process in the broader context of best practices for collaborative open science and scientific reproducibility. Further, it highlights a successful path by which the shift towards ecosystem-based management can be actuated.},

	abstract = {Resource managers worldwide are being asked to consider the ecosystem while making management decisions. Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) provides a flexible framework for addressing ecosystem considerations in decision making. The US Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) adapted the IEA approach and implemented a structured decision framework to address species, fleet, habitat, and climate interactions as part of their Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in 2016. The Council’s EAFM decision framework first uses risk assessment to prioritize fishery-ecosystem interactions for consideration. The Council’s 2017 EAFM risk assessment identified a range of ecological, social, and management objectives or risk elements. Development of a conceptual model to identify key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery is the second step in the framework. The Council identified summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) as a high-risk fishery and finalized an EAFM conceptual model that considers high-risk factors and ecosystem elements in 2019. The Council used the conceptual model to identify three priority summer flounder management questions (recreational data uncertainty, recreational discards, and distribution shifts) to be considered for quantitative management strategy evaluation, the third step in the EAFM framework and set to begin in 2020. Finally, as strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or other priorities identified in the risk assessment can be addressed. The Council’s rapid progress in implementing EAFM resulted from an extensive, positive, and collaborative process between managers, stakeholders, and scientists. Collaboration helps build trust and buy-in from all participants and is essential to IEA and to the success of EAFM.},

	abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework. We fit models with and without (independent or autocorrelated) random effects on NAA, M, and selectivity to data from five stocks with a broad range of life history, fishing pressure, number of ages, and time-series length. Models that included random effects performed well across stocks and processes, especially random effects models with a two dimensional (2D) first-order autoregressive, AR(1), covariance structure over age and year. We conducted simulation tests and found negligible or no bias in estimation of important assessment outputs (SSB, F, stock status, and catch) when the operating and estimation models matched. However, bias in SSB and F was often non-trivial when the estimation model was less complex than the operating model, especially when models without random effects were fit to data simulated from models with random effects. Bias of the variance and correlation parameters controlling random effects was also negligible or slightly negative as expected. Our results suggest that WHAM can be a useful tool for stock assessment when environmental effects on R or M, or stochastic variation in NAA transitions, M, or selectivity are of interest. In the U.S. Northeast, where the productivity of several groundfish stocks has declined, conducting assessments in WHAM with time-varying processes via random effects or environment-productivity links may account for these trends and potentially reduce retrospective bias.},

However, less evidence exists for regime shifts in fish recruitment success, particularly for synchronized regimes across multiple species. Here, we analyzed stock assessment output and survey data to test for regimes in the recruitment success of 18 commercially important marine species over a 29 yr timespan. We then tested whether recruitment regimes coincide with regimes in the zooplankton community, and whether the abundance of large spawners could explain the patterns in recruitment. We found evidence for 3 decadal-scale recruitment regimes: low recruitment success in the 1980s, high success in the 1990s, and a return to low recruitment success in the 2000s. This general pattern was found in all datasets of recruitment. The abundance of large spawners did not appear to be a broad-scale driver of recruitment success; however, recruitment regimes coincided with regimes in copepod abundance and size structure.},

	abstract = {Marine capture fisheries in the U.S. are important from a societal, cultural, economic, and ecological perspective. Although fisheries in the U.S. are generally well-managed, they still face some challenges as do most fisheries around the world. To address these challenges, a broader, more systematic approach is useful. There is a global need to develop measures of ecosystem overfishing (EOF) that detect overfishing of an entire ecosystem using readily available data and based on widely repeatable patterns. These EOF indicators extend the thinking beyond single stock overfishing to an entire ecosystem and are largely based on well-established trophic theory. Moreover, these EOF indicators need to be germane for both data rich and especially data limited situations, easily interpretable, and relatively simple to calculate. Here, I present the results of several of these indicators—the Ryther, Fogarty, and Friedland indices—as well as indices based on cumulative biomass-Trophic Level curve parameters for eight U.S. Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). Significantly, all these EOF indicators also have thresholds beyond which EOF is indicated, particularly when coupled with other evidence. Evidence for EOF is suggested for two of the eight U.S. LMEs. Even apart from EOF thresholds, detecting whether EOF is occurring, or how debatable the proposed EOF thresholds are, there are multiple benefits from monitoring these ecosystem-level indicators. Detecting patterns and trends in overall fishing changes for an ecosystem is chief among them. Additionally, EOF indicators detected changes in these LMEs at least 2–3 years, even up to 5 years prior to major impacts that might not be identified by piecing together fishing impacts on a stock-by-stock basis; thus, the EOF indicators could serve as an early warning signal. I propose that instead of starting with the history of which stocks have been assessed or even with what we deem most valuable, we look at the entire system of fisheries in an LME and if EOF is detected, explore means to address excess fishing pressure systematically before delving into the details of specific stocks. I conclude that EOF measures need to be monitored, EOF thresholds refined, and if EOF is detected then the means to mitigate total fishing pressure in an ecosystem should be explored.},
