# Ongoing analysis

## Baseline primary production

* Calculated regional estimates of C using similar approach (average TL, TE)
  * PP for MAB from satellite data ([data source](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/chl-pp.html))

## Use species trophic level information

* Contrast with species specific trophic level information (from fishbase)
* Calculate a system wide "average" trophic level, $TL_{a}$, using the idea that primary production required to support the total catch is equal to the sum of primary production required for each species catch

  $$\sum_{i=1}^n C_i \left(\frac{1}{TE}\right)^{TL_i -1} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n C_i \right)\frac{1}{TE}^{TL_{a}-1}$$

# Appendix: Ecosystem Overfishing Indicators

The amount of potential yield we can expect from a marine ecosystem depends on 
* The amount of production entering at the base of the food web, primarily in the form of phytoplankton
* The pathways this energy follows to reach harvested species
* The efficiency of transfer of energy at each step in the food web
* The fraction of this production that is removed by the fisheries

## Ryther, Fogarty, Friedland Indices

The *Ryther index* consists of total catch presented on a per unit-area basis for an ecosystem. 

The *Fogarty index* is the ratio of total catches to total primary productivity in an ecosystem.

The *Friedland index* is the ratio of total catches to mean annual chlorophyll in an ecosystem.

From `r Cite(myBib, "link_evidence_2021")` "One can develop and estimate thresholds for them based on first principles, trophic transfer theory, and empirical evidence." Thresholds were proposed `r Cite(myBib, "link_global_2019")`

## Link and Watson 2019 overview
<!--
![:img Link and Watson 2019 Fig 1](https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/sciadv.aav0474/asset/6b94e27e-71ae-431f-9e8b-7b6378122215/assets/graphic/aav0474-f1.jpeg) -->
.footnote[Link and Watson 2019, https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aav0474]

All three indices are based on the principle of energy transfer up the foodweb from primary producers. There are limits to how much an ecosystem can produce and potentially be caught, C in tons $year^{-1}$

<!-- $$C = \alpha \sum_{i=1}^{TL} PP.TE_i^{TL_i-i}$$ -->
$$C = \alpha PP.TE^{TL-1}$$
where



$PP$ = primary production ( tons C $year^{-1}$ )

$TE$ = Transfer efficiency 

$TL$ = Trophic level


$\alpha$ is "a scalar for local conditions (set to 15% -20% for average availability of the TL in estimating total catch, a value that emerges when estimated from maintaining a global average catch that has been stable for the past 30 yrs)"

This equation is primary production required (PPR) rearranged to express Catch in terms of PP rather than PP in terms of Catch (at the system aggregate level)

* Range of values for $\alpha$ (10%-20%), TE (10%-14%), and TL(3.2-3.6), PP (40-50 Gt C $year^{-1}$) selected to bound the problem. The bounds help define the thresholds.


* Range of estimated C = 0.1 to 1 Gt $year^{-1}$
* Middle ground estimate of C = .42 Gt $year^{-1}$
  *   using $\alpha$ = 0.15, TE = 12%, TL = 3.4, PP = 45Gt C $year^{-1}$
  *   Carbon to wet weight conversion of 10
* These help define the thresholds for all indices

## Link and Watson 2019 overview:  Ryther Index

.pull-left[

Defined as total catch per unit area in the ecosystem `r Cite(myBib, "link_global_2019")`. The units are mt $km^{-2} year^{-1}$

The upper bound of the optimal range, (using C = .42 $Gt year^{-1}$) is calculated as:

Ryther = $\frac{.42 Gt year^{-1} 10^9}{363 km^{-2}10^6} ~= 1.16 t km^{-2}year^{-1}$

where the worlds oceans are approximately 363 million $km^2$ 

  * Assumes each $km^2$ of ocean is equally productive
  
  * We'd like to estimate thresholds in a similar fashion but at a smaller spatial scale using regional estimates of PP and using knowledge of the ecosystem.
