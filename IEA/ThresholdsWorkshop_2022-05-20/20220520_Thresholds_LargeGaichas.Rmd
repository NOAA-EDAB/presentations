Declining commercial and recreational landings can be driven by many interacting factors, including combinations of ecosystem and stock production, management actions, market conditions, and environmental change. While we cannot evaluate all possible drivers at present, here we evaluate the extent to which ecosystem overfishing (total landings exceeding ecosystem productive capacity), stock status, and system biomass trends may play a role.

## Ecosystem overfishing indices support the Seafood Production objective in the SOE (2021)

Thresholds for ecosystem-level overfishing based on system production characteristics have been proposed `r Cite(myBib, "link_global_2019")`, and are applied here for the MAB. The proposed ecosystem overfishing thresholds are calculated based on *total catch* while our preliminary indicators are based on *commercial landings*. Therefore, our current indicators are underestimated compared with the proposed thresholds. In future reports we may be able to include commercial discards and recreational removals to evaluate total catch. 

Based on either the ratio of total landings to total primary production (Fogarty Index), or total landings per unit area (Ryther Index), MAB landings are at or below the proposed thresholds, so ecosystem overfishing is unlikely to be a major factor driving decreased landings.

Are changes in landings driven by changes in ecosystem productivity or ecosystem overfishing?

FIG. 1 Schematic of stock and EOF.
(A) Schematic of population overfishing. While a population is experiencing overfishing, the abundance and biomass (here as the number of fish icons) and fish size declines over time, along with many other facets related to population and fleet dynamics. (B) Schematic of EOF. Analogous to population overfishing, EOF is the result of continued fishing pressure on multiple populations, leading to sequential depletion across populations in an ecosystem over time.

## Link and Watson 2019 overview

*  Global analysis   
*  Catch and primary production (PP) based  
*  Three indices developed  
    + Ryther: total catch per unit area (global average PP assumed)  
    + Fogarty: ratio of total catch to total PP within an ecosystem   
    + Friedland: ratio of total catch to chlorophyll within an ecosystem 
*  Overfishing thresholds for each index proposed  

*  Ecosystem overfishing (EOF) defined as:  

> an instance where the sum of all catches is flat or declining, total catch per unit effort (CPUE) is declining, and total landings relative to ecosystem production exceeds suitable limits.

## How we implemented [(tech-doc)](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/ecosystem-overfishing.html)

## Methods

We use the definition of ecosystem overfishing from `r Cite(myBib, "link_global_2019")`: 

1. The sum of catches is flat or declining
1. Total catch per unit effort is declining
1. Total landings relative to ecosystem  production exceeds suitable limits

All of the indices are based on the principle of energy transfer up the foodweb from primary producers.

### Fogarty & Ryther Indices

The Fogarty index is defined as ratio of total catches to total primary productivity in an ecosystem `r Cite(myBib, "link_global_2019")`. The units are parts per thousand.

The Ryther index is defined as total catch per unit area in the ecosystem `r Cite(myBib, "link_global_2019")`. The units are mt km^-2 year^-1

A modification of the indices is used. Total landings are used in lieu of total catch. This will have the effect of reducing the value of the index (compared to using total catch).

## How we implemented [(tech-doc)](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/ecosystem-overfishing.html)

#### Data sources

Data for this index come from a variety of sources. The landings data come from the Commercial Fishery Database (CFDBS), species trophic level information come from [fishbase](http://fishbase.de) and [sealifebase](http://sealifebase.ca), and primary production estimates are derived from [satellites](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/chl-pp.html). Some of these data are typically not available to the public.

#### Data extraction

Landings are extracted from the commercial fisheries database (CFDBS) using the methods described in the chapter [Commercial Landings Data.](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/comdat.html)

Primary Production is estimated using the methods described in the chapter [Chlorophyll a and Primary Production.](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/chl-pp.html)

#### Data analysis

##### Fogarty and Ryther Indices

Total annual (wet weight) landings are calculated for a given EPU (summed over all species). The units for both primary production and landings are in $mt km^{-2} year^1$. A factor of (1/9) is used to convert landings to weight in carbon. The area in $km^2$ of each EPU is obtained from the shapefile used to define the area.

## Known issues and questions

(2021 SOE Request Memo)

1. The proposed ecosystem overfishing thresholds are calculated based on *total catch* while our preliminary indicators are based on *commercial landings*. Therefore, our current indicators are underestimated compared with the proposed thresholds. It is possible to add commercial discards and recreational landings and dead discards in the future, or to calculate how much additional catch is required to exceed a threshold.

2. The proposed ecosystem overfishing thresholds are based on a global analysis. The indices define ecosystem productivity in different ways. The Ryther Index is effectively based on fishery removals relative to global primary productivity per unit area, while the Fogarty Index is based on fishery removals relative to regional primary productivity `r Cite(myBib, "link_global_2019")`. The study authors "recommend that the indices proposed here be used cognizant of other potential sources of productivity and that are relevant to the scale at which fisheries management mostly occurs."

A full set of plots to help interpret the primary production required and ecosystem overfishing indices (including mean trophic level, which species are included in the landings, and the primary production time series) are available [online](https://noaa-edab.github.io/eofindices/articles/currentIndices.html). We welcome suggestions to include additional plots or conduct analyses to improve interpretation of these indices for the Councils.

## Progress on estimating NEUS total catch for input into ecosystem overfishing indicators [(soenotes)](https://andybeet.github.io/soenotes/articles/landingsComparison.html)

.pull-left[
*Comparing all catch/landings data sources*

Note: Link data, SAU data, and NAFO data are estimates of Catch whereas `comlandr` data is landings only (no discards)

![All data sources from Andy's soenotes landingsComparison vignette](https://andybeet.github.io/soenotes/articles/landingsComparison_files/figure-html/combine-1.png)

.pull-right[
*Resulting ecosystem overfishing indices*

The estimated percentage of unreported catch from the SAU dataset is applied to comland data estimate to represent total comland catch.

Ultimately, for the NEFSC State of the Ecosystem report these ecosystem overfishing indices will be calculated for multiple sub areas within the NEUS, namely Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine and the Mid Atlantic Bight. Knowing that the estimates of total NEUS catches are in line with other data sources is paramount to the acceptance of the report.

# Discussion

Using Link and Watson 2019 as a starting point, not an end point

How would we recommend the Council use ecosystem overfishing indicators?

Data issues being worked through
*  Previous indicators based on landings, need total catch
*  Resolving different total catch estimates from different sources

What analyses can we do to tailor to our regional ecosystem and managers?

*  Simulation test suggested thresholds with regional ecosystem model
*  Establish thresholds for our region/managed species
    + Process: define unacceptable ecosystem state, dont go there
    + Easier than defining optimal state, too many

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).
