# US Policy defines EBFM as:

## A systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals.

b. Ecosystem factors outside the stock assessment affecting short term prediction  
  + General measures of ecosystem productivity and habitat stability (e.g., primary production amount and timing, temperature trends, etc.);
  + Comparisons among related species; e.g., recruitment, growth, condition patterns across Mid Atlantic fish species stable, varying synchronously, or varying unpredictably;
  + Climate vulnerability or other risk assessment evaluation of potential for changing productivity under changing conditions.

The Council’s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

#fogarty, fig.cap="Fogarty Index; the ratio of total landings to total primary production in the MAB. Link and Watson (2019) give an optimal range (green shading) of the Fogarty ratio of 0.22 to 0.92 parts per thousand (PPT). Previous work suggested that index values exceeding 1 to 2 PPT (orange shading) led to ecosystem tipping points."

#ryther, fig.cap="Ryther index; total landings presented on a unit area basis for the MAB. Theoretical estimates (Link and Watson, 2019) imply the index should range from 0.3 - 1.1 mt per sq km annually (green shading) with a limit of 3 mt per sq km annually, above which tipping points could occur in fished ecosystems (orange shading). Expected system-wide MSYs can be in the range of 1 to 3 mt per sq km (unshaded)."

Declining commercial and recreational landings can be driven by many interacting factors, including combinations of ecosystem and stock production, management actions, market conditions, and environmental change. While we cannot evaluate all possible drivers at present, here we evaluate the extent to which ecosystem overfishing (total landings exceeding ecosystem productive capacity), stock status, and system biomass trends may play a role.

## Next steps

Focus on developing *decision processes* that are able to use ecosystem information

*  Collaborative, iterative process between scientists, managers, stakeholders
*  Ecosystem reporting, risk and vulnerablity assessment useful tools
*  Stock level ESPs a good example
*  Multispecies and system level indicators of productivity change and overexploitation
