	abstract = {Populations of small pelagic fish are strongly influenced by climate. The inability of managers to anticipate environment-driven fluctuations in stock productivity or distribution can lead to overfishing and stock collapses, inflexible management regulations inducing shifts in the functional response to human predators, lost opportunities to harvest populations, bankruptcies in the fishing industry, and loss of resilience in the human food supply. Recent advances in dynamical global climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here we assess the utility of SST predictions at this “fishery relevant” scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However, to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast, it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.},

	abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

	abstract = {An ecosystem approach to forage ﬁsh management is required because forage ﬁsh support large ﬁsheries, are prey for many valued species in marine food webs, and provide important social and cultural beneﬁts to humans. Complex ecosystem models are often used to evaluate potential ecosystem consequences of forage ﬁsh ﬁsheries, but there is seldom sufﬁcient data to parameterize them, and full consideration of uncertainty is impossible. Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE) provide a link between full ecosystem models and tactical (usually single-species) models typically used in ﬁsheries management. MICE are ideal tools to form the basis for management strategy evaluations that compare the ability of candidate strategies to achieve goals related to target ﬁsheries and broader ecosystem protection objectives. A MICE model is developed for the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) that focuses on the ﬁshery for the northern subpopulation of Paciﬁc sardine (Sardinops sajax) and the indirect impacts of the ﬁshery on place-based predators, in particular brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), in the Southern California Bight. The model includes three forage species (sardine, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and ‘other forage’), an ‘other prey’ category, and two predator species (brown pelican and California sea lion) and evaluates the impacts of variable forage availability on adult predator reproductive success and survival. Parameterization of the model is based on available monitoring data and assessment outputs. The model is used to assess the ecosystem and ﬁshery consequences of the current sardine management systems for Mexico, the USA, and Canada, with a focus on identifying which among a long list of sources of uncertainty in the system are most consequential for predictions of ﬁshery impacts on predators. Key sources of uncertainty to consider in ecosystem assessments for the CCE are how prey abundance and availability impact predator demography and the extent to which the dynamics of prey populations are driven by environmental factors. Data are available for some of these sources of uncertainty for CCE sardine management, but much uncertainty remains, necessitating exploration of sensitivity to alternative model formulations and parameter values when providing advice on management strategies to decision makers.},

These distinguished predators based upon prey size and location in the water column (i.e., benthic to pelagic feeding). Ontogenetic diet shifts were important in guild structure, particularly within dominant piscivores. The mean dietary overlap both between and within guilds was notably lower than in other fish communities due to the broad spatial and temporal scale of the study, the diversity of prey types consumed, and the generalist nature of predators in this system. The guild concept is a useful framework to simplify highly connected, complex ecosystems like the Northeast US continental shelf and identify ecologically similar functional units.},

Pacific Herring are emblematic of the management issues facing forage species—they are central components of the Northeast Pacific pelagic food web and support important commercial fisheries. In addition, the importance of Herring to indigenous peoples have made them cultural keystone species. We employed a participatory process to promote collaborative priority-setting for this critical forage species. Working with managers, the fisheries industry, indigenous peoples, and scientists, we co-constructed a conceptual model of the Pacific Herring social–ecological system in the Northeast Pacific. We then identified a set of questions, that, if answered, would significantly increase our ability to sustainably manage the Herring . Our objective was to generate a road map for scientists who wish to conduct useful forage fish research, for resource managers who wish to develop new research efforts that could fill critical gaps, and for public agencies and private foundations seeking to prioritize funding on forage fish issues in the Pacific. With this socio-cultural centrality comes complexity for fisheries management. Our participatory process highlighted the value of conceptualizing the full SES, overcame disciplinary differences in scientific approaches, research philosophy, and language, and charted a path forward for future research and management for forage species.},

	abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework. We fit models with and without (independent or autocorrelated) random effects on NAA, M, and selectivity to data from five stocks with a broad range of life history, fishing pressure, number of ages, and time-series length. Models that included random effects performed well across stocks and processes, especially random effects models with a two dimensional (2D) first-order autoregressive, AR(1), covariance structure over age and year. We conducted simulation tests and found negligible or no bias in estimation of important assessment outputs (SSB, F, stock status, and catch) when the operating and estimation models matched. However, bias in SSB and F was often non-trivial when the estimation model was less complex than the operating model, especially when models without random effects were fit to data simulated from models with random effects. Bias of the variance and correlation parameters controlling random effects was also negligible or slightly negative as expected. Our results suggest that WHAM can be a useful tool for stock assessment when environmental effects on R or M, or stochastic variation in NAA transitions, M, or selectivity are of interest. In the U.S. Northeast, where the productivity of several groundfish stocks has declined, conducting assessments in WHAM with time-varying processes via random effects or environment-productivity links may account for these trends and potentially reduce retrospective bias.},

	abstract = {The Northwest Atlantic marine community underwent dramatic changes during the last 30years, including the collapse of many groundfish stocks and an increase in shrimp populations. Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides is an important commercial species and one of the top fish predators in this system. It is a large, wide-ranging flatfish that is found at depths up to 2200m and it has an opportunistic diet which makes it a potential candidate for an ecosystem indicator. Analysis of stomach contents of Greenland halibut between 1978 and 2003 indicates that diet composition reflects the major changes in community structure. Over the entire period there was a clear increase in the importance of invertebrates, particularly after 1992. This change was associated with a higher importance of Pandalus shrimp and Gonatus squid and a protracted reliance on zooplankton by predators under 25cm length. Capelin Mallotus villosus was the dominant prey between 1978 and 1992 for predators in the 12–63cm range, but its importance dropped off drastically in the mid 1990s. Levels of main prey in the diet of Greenland halibut correlated well with fishery-independent surveys. Greenland halibut sample capelin well, compared to bottom trawl surveys and acoustic surveys. Greenland halibut consumed small shrimp which are not routinely caught by surveys and may be important in deriving information on year classes and growth of shrimp. Our results suggest that Greenland halibut's diet is a useful tracker of ecosystem change.},

	abstract = {Time series indicators are widely used in ecosystem-based management. A suite of indicators is typically calculated for a static region or multiple subregions and presented in an ecosystem assessment (EA). These are used to guide management decisions or determine environmental status. Yet, few studies have examined how the spatial scale of an EA influences indicator behavior. We explore this question using the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf ecosystem (USA). We systematically divided the ecosystem at six spatial scales (31 unique units), covering spatial extents from 250,000 km2 to 20,000 km2. The same 22 indicators were calculated for each unit, assessed for trends, and evaluated as 31 independent EAs. We found that the detected signals of indicator trends depended on the spatial scale at which the ecosystem was defined. A single EA for the whole region differed by 23\% (in terms of the 22 indicator trend tests) relative to ones for spatially nested 120,000 km2 subunits, and by up to 36\% for EAs at smaller scales. Indicator trend disagreement occurred because (most common) a localized trend was perceived as widespread, (common) a local trend was obscured by aggregating data over a large region, or (least common) a local trend switched direction when examined at a broader scale. Yet, there was variation among indicators in their scale sensitivity related to trophic level. Indicators of temperature, chlorophyll-a, and zooplankton were spatially coherent: trends portrayed were similar regardless of scale. Mid-trophic level indicators (fish and invertebrates) showed more spatial variation in trends. We also compared trend magnitude and indicator values to spatial extent and found relationships consistent with scaling theory. Indicators at broad scales produced subdued trends and values relative to indicators developed at smaller spatial scales, which often portrayed ‘hotspots’ of local abundance or strong trend. Our results imply that subsequent uses of indicators (e.g., determining environmental status, risk assessments, management decisions) are also sensitive to ecosystem delineation and scale. We suggest that indicators and EAs should be done at multiple spatial scales and complimented with spatially explicit analysis to reflect the hierarchical structure of ecosystems. One scale is not best, but rather we gain a new level of understanding at each scale examined that can contribute to management decisions in a multiscale governance framework characterized by goals and objectives with relevance at different scales.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of predator–prey relationships, the structure of food webs, and the foraging behavior of individuals are critical to understanding animal ecology, interactions of predators with their prey, and effects of environmental variability on ecosystems. Like many other predators, seabirds are effective samplers of prey populations, and their diets can provide information about lower trophic levels over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Recognizing limitations of traditional methods of diet analysis, we validated the use of fatty acid (FA) signatures of subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies for estimating diets of free-ranging seabirds. Calibration coefficients (CCs) for individual FAs were determined from captive common murres (n = 13) fed a long-term, single-species diet. Quantitative FA signature analysis (QFASA), using these CCs, was then validated in murres (n = 26) and red-legged kittiwakes (n = 13) fed controlled mixed-species diets. FAs were analyzed from 426 free-ranging red-legged Rissa brevirostris and black-legged kittiwakes R. tridactyla, and common Uria aalge and thick-billed murres U. lomvia from the Bering Sea, 284 of which were also sampled for stomach contents analysis. Qualitatively, FA signatures revealed distinct separation of diets among all 4 species, and further separation by location and year. QFASA diet estimates were similar to those based on stomach contents, with diets of kittiwakes dominated by myctophids, while those of murres comprised a mixture of other forage species. QFASA estimates were indicative of regional habitat differences, and were consistent with other aspects of seabird ecology at our study sites. We conclude that seabird FAs provide important information about ecosystems, but this will likely depend on each species’ foraging behavior and the complexities of the ecosystem it occupies.},

Such relationships were assessed using indices of predator performance (response vectors) for four predator species, together with independent ship-based acoustic estimates of abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), from South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. Out of 32 response vectors investigated, 13 showed a significant non-linear relationship, based on a Holling Type II response, to krill abundance, and just five showed a significant linear relationship. Predator responses reflecting the processes during summer, when prey surveys were undertaken, showed the closest relationship with prey abundance. Distinct relationships existed between the variability of indices and the biological processes they measured. Body mass variables had the lowest variability (CVs \&lt;10\%), whereas those measuring breeding success showed the greatest variability (CVs \&gt;50\%). Multivariate indices, produced by combining response vectors from all four predator species into a single combined index, provided a better fit with krill data than any of the individual vectors. Whereas population size parameters for individual species showed no relationship with annual estimates of krill abundance, a combined, multispecies population size index did show a significant response. Understanding the form of the relationship between concurrent indicators of prey abundance and key ecosystem metrics/reference points, such as population size, is crucial to the application of monitoring data to management action.},

	abstract = {Background Studies that attempt to measure shifts in species distributions often consider a single species in isolation. However, understanding changes in spatial overlap between predators and their prey might provide deeper insight into how species redistribution affects food web dynamics. Predator–prey overlap metrics Here, we review a suite of 10 metrics [range overlap, area overlap, the local index of collocation (Pianka's O), Hurlbert's index, biomass-weighted overlap, asymmetrical alpha, Schoener's D, Bhattacharyya's coefficient, the global index of collocation and the AB ratio] that describe how two species overlap in space, using concepts such as binary co-occurrence, encounter rates, spatial niche similarity, spatial independence, geographical similarity and trophic transfer. We describe the specific ecological insights that can be gained using each overlap metric, in order to determine which is most appropriate for describing spatial predator–prey interactions for different applications. Simulation and case study We use simulated predator and prey distributions to demonstrate how the 10 metrics respond to variation in three types of predator–prey interactions: changing spatial overlap between predator and prey, changing predator population size and changing patterns of predator aggregation in response to prey density. We also apply these overlap metrics to a case study of a predatory fish (arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias) and its prey (juvenile walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Eastern Bering Sea, AK, USA. We show how the metrics can be applied to understand spatial and temporal variation in the overlap of species distributions in this rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem. Conclusions Using both simulated and empirical data, we provide a roadmap for ecologists and other practitioners to select overlap metrics to describe particular aspects of spatial predator–prey interactions. We outline a range of research and management applications for which each metric may be suited.},

However, diet-based biomass indices may be sensitive to underlying ecological dynamics between predators and prey, such as predator functional responses and changes in overlap in space and time. To evaluate these factors, we fit spatio-temporal models to stomach contents of five Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) predators and survey catch data for predators and Atlantic herring. We identified drivers of variation in stomach contents, evaluated spatial patterns in stomach content data, and produced predator-specific indices of seasonal Atlantic herring biomass. After controlling for spatio-temporal processes and predator length, diet-based indices of biomass shared similar decadal trends but varied substantially between predators and seasons on shorter time scales. Diet-based indices reflected prey biomass more than prey availability, but weak correlations indicated that not all biological processes were controlled for. Results provide potential guidance for developing diet-based biomass indices and contribute to a body of evidence demonstrating the utility of predator diet data to provide information about relative prey biomass.},

However, there is no statistical method for processing stomach content data that accounts for fine-scale spatio-temporal structure while expanding individual stomach samples to population-level estimates of predation. Therefore, we developed an approach that fits a spatio-temporal model to both prey-biomass-per-predator-biomass data (i.e. the ratio of prey biomass in stomachs to predator weight) and predator biomass survey data, to predict “predator-expanded-stomach-contents” (PESCs). PESC estimates can be used to visualize either the annual landscape of PESCs (spatio-temporal variation), or can be aggregated across space to calculate annual variation in diet proportions (variation among prey items and among years). We demonstrated our approach in two contrasting scenarios: a data-rich situation involving eastern Bering Sea (EBS) large-size walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) for 1992–2015; and a data-limited situation involving West Florida Shelf red grouper (Epinephelus morio, Epinephelidae) for 2011–2015. Large walleye pollock PESC was predicted to be higher in very warm years on the Middle Shelf of the EBS, where food is abundant. Red grouper PESC was variable in north-western Florida waters, presumably due to spatio-temporal variation in harmful algal bloom severity. Our approach can be employed to parameterize or validate diverse ecosystem models, and can serve to address many fundamental ecological questions, such as providing an improved understanding of how climate-driven changes in spatial overlap between predator and prey distributions might influence predation pressure.},

	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

	abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade-offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40\% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

Here, we use species distribution models to estimate the change in shelf occupancy, mean weighted latitude, and mean weighted depth of six forage fishes on the Northeast US shelf, and whether those trends were linked to coincident hydrographic conditions. Our results suggest that observed shelf occupancy is increasing or unchanging for most species in both spring and fall, linked both to gear shifts and increasing bottom temperature and salinity. Exceptions include decreases to observed shelf occupancy by sand lance and decreases to Atlantic herring's inferred habitat suitability in the fall. Our work shows that changes in shelf occupancy and inferred habitat suitability have varying coherence, indicating complex mechanisms behind observed shelf occupancy for many species. Future work and management can use these results to better isolate the aspects of forage fish life histories that are important for determining their occupancy of the Northeast US shelf.},

Here, we investigate whether the stock has shifted and the extent to which this can be attributed to changes in abundance, size-structure, environmental variables, and fishing. We do so using a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal model that incorporates data from two seasonal bottom trawl surveys that together span the nearshore and offshore Northeast US shelf over the past 41 years. We find that the summer flounder distribution has shifted north and east in both the spring and fall. The shift is observed in both recruits and spawners, with recruits shifting northward faster than spawners, suggesting that increased spawner abundance may not be driving the shift in recruits. We find that only a small portion of the variability in distribution can be attributed to changes in abundance, fishing, or environmental covariates. Instead, the shift is most strongly attributed to unidentified factors.},

Range edges are where colonization and extirpation processes unfold, and so these dynamics are also important to understand for effective natural resource management and conservation. However, few studies to date have analyzed time series of range edge positions in the context of climate change, in part because range edges are difficult to detect. We first quantified positions for 165 range edges of marine fishes and invertebrates from three U.S. continental shelf regions using up to five decades of survey data and a spatiotemporal model to account for sampling and measurement variability. We then analyzed whether those range edges maintained their edge thermal niche—the temperatures found at the range edge position—over time. A large majority of range edges (88\%) maintained either summer or winter temperature extremes at the range edge over the study period, and most maintained both (76\%), although not all of those range edges shifted in space. However, we also found numerous range edges—particularly poleward edges and edges in the region that experienced the most warming—that did not shift at all, shifted further than predicted by temperature alone, or shifted opposite the direction expected, underscoring the multiplicity of factors that drive changes in range edge positions. This study suggests that range edges of temperate marine species have largely maintained the same edge thermal niche during periods of rapid change and provides a blueprint for testing whether and to what degree species range edges track temperature in general.},

In two localities, sympatric Anolis species with differential occurrences in sun or shade sought lower, more shaded perches during midday, resulting in partly nonsynchronous utilization of the vegetation by the two species. The second observation may be related to the first in the following way: nonsynchronous spatial overlap could dictate relatively great resource overlap for species coinhabiting patchy or edge areas, requiring great differences between the species in prey size in addition to those in climatic habitat. The extent of such overlap on small depauperate islands could be greater if these contained a greater proportion of patchy or edge habitats (with respect to insolation), or if climatic preferences were broader and more overlapping than on large, species—rich islands. In each locality, the relatively more shade—inhabiting species occurred more often on larger perches and on lower perches than did the other species. In both species of the Bermudan pair, adult males occupied higher and larger perches, and in grahami, shadier perches, than did female—sized individuals. The statistical significance of these and other differences was evaluated using several unweighted g2 procedures, Cochran's weighted g2 test and a partitioning technique for analyzing interactions among variables in complex contingency tables. The last method is described in detail in the papaer by Fienberg, immediately following this one.},

	abstract = {Integrating food web indicators into ecological status assessments is central to developing effective management measures that can improve degraded ecosystems. This is because they can reveal how ecosystems respond to environmental change that cannot be inferred from studying habitat, species or assemblages alone. However, the substantial investment required to monitor food webs (e.g. via stomach contents analysis) and the lack of internationally agreed approaches to assessing them has hampered their development. Inventories of trophic interactions have been collated world-wide and across biomes, and can be applied to infer food web structure and energy flow. Here, we compile a new marine dataset containing 8,092 unique predator–prey interactions from 415,294 fish stomachs. We demonstrate how feeding guilds (i.e. groupings based on diet and life stage) could be defined systematically and in a way that is conducive to their application internationally across ecosystems; and apply them to the North Sea fish assemblage to demonstrate their responsiveness to anthropogenic pressures. We found evidence for seven distinct feeding guilds. Differences between guilds were related to predator size, which positively correlated with piscivory, phylogeny, with multiple size classes of a species often in the same guild, and habitat, as pelagic, benthic and shallow-coastal foraging was apparent. Guild biomasses were largely consistent through time at the North Sea-level and spatially aggregated at the regional level with change relating to changes in resource availability, temperature, fishing and the biomass of other guilds. This suggests that fish biomass was partitioned across broad feeding and environmental niches, and changes over time were governed partly by guild carrying capacities, but also by a combination of covariates with contrasting patterns of change. Management of the North Sea ecosystem could therefore be adaptive and focused towards specific guilds and pressures in a given area. Synthesis and applications. We propose a food web indicator which has been explicitly called for to inform policy via food web status assessment as part of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the indicator toolkit supporting The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the ‘OSPAR Convention’).},

In the autumn of 2009, 2010 and 2011, stomach and tissue samples were taken from 20 fish and invertebrate species for analysis of diet composition and δ15N and δ13C signatures. The food chain in Rhode Island and Block Island Sounds comprises approximately four trophic levels within which the fish community is divided into distinct dietary guilds, including planktivores, benthivores, crustacivores and piscivores. Within these guilds, inter-species isotopic and dietary overlap is high, suggesting that resource partitioning or competitive interactions play a major role in structuring the fish community. Carbon isotopes indicate that most fishes are supported by pelagic phytoplankton, although there is evidence that benthic production also plays a role, particularly for obligate benthivores such as skates Leucoraja spp. This type of analysis is useful for developing an ecosystem-based approach to management, as it identifies species that act as direct links to basal resources as well as species groups that share trophic roles.},

Menhaden management has been working toward ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for menhaden’s role in the ecosystem. The goal of this work was to develop menhaden ERPs using ecosystem models. An existing Ecopath with Ecosim model of the Northwest Atlantic Continental Shelf (NWACS) was reduced in complexity from 61 to 17 species/functional groups. The new NWACS model of intermediate complexity for ecosystems (NWACS-MICE) serves to link the dynamics of menhaden with key managed predators. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) were determined to be most sensitive to menhaden harvest and therefore served as an indicator of ecosystem impacts. ERPs were based on the tradeoff relationship between the equilibrium biomass of striped bass and menhaden fishing mortality (F). The ERPs were defined as the menhaden F rates that maintain striped bass at their biomass target and threshold when striped bass are fished at their Ftarget, and all other modeled species were fished at status quo levels. These correspond to an ERP Ftarget of 0.19 and an ERP Fthreshold of 0.57, which are lower than the single species reference points by 30–40\%, but higher than current (2017) menhaden F. The ERPs were then fed back into the age-structured stock assessment model projections to provide information on total allowable catch. The ERPs developed in this study were adopted by the Atlantic menhaden Management Board, marking a shift toward ecosystem-based fishery management for this economically and ecologically important species.},

	abstract = {Atlantic menhaden is an important forage fish and the target of the largest fishery along the US East Coast by volume. Since 1999, managers at the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, stakeholders, and scientists have been interested in developing ecological reference points (ERPs) that account for menhaden’s role as a forage species. To accomplish this, we developed a suite of modeling approaches that incorporated predation on menhaden and changes in productivity over time and allowed for evaluation of trade-offs between menhaden harvest and ecosystem management objectives. These approaches ranged in complexity, from models with minimal data requirements and few assumptions to approaches with extensive data needs and detailed assumptions. This included a surplus production model with a time-varying intrinsic growth rate, a Steele-Henderson surplus production model, a multispecies statistical catch-at-age model, an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model with a limited predator and prey field, and a full EwE model. We evaluated how each model could address managers’ objectives and compared outputs across the approaches, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and management utility. All models produced estimates of age-1 + biomass and exploitation rate that were similar in trend and magnitude to the single-species statistical catch-at-age model, especially in recent years. While the less complex models were relativity easy to implement and update, they lacked key elements needed to manage multiple species simultaneously. More complex models required a wider array of data and were more difficult to update within the current management time-frames, but produced a more useful framework for managers. Ultimately, an EwE model of intermediate complexity coupled with the existing single-species assessment model was recommended for use in management.},

	abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (“derived quantities”) are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional “plug-in” estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new “epsilon” estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25° and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR’s near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1° OI analyses. The AVHRR-only product uses Pathfinder AVHRR data (currently available from January 1985 to December 2005) and operational AVHRR data for 2006 onward. Pathfinder AVHRR was chosen over operational AVHRR, when available, because Pathfinder agrees better with the in situ data. The AMSR–AVHRR product begins with the start of AMSR data in June 2002. In this product, the primary AVHRR contribution is in regions near land where AMSR is not available. However, in cloud-free regions, use of both infrared and microwave instruments can reduce systematic biases because their error characteristics are independent.},

	abstract = {Delta-models (a.k.a. hurdle models) are widely used to fit biomass samples that include zeros and a skewed response for positive catches, and spatio-temporal extensions of these models are increasingly used to quantify trends in abundance (i.e., estimate abundance indices). Previous research has shown estimated indices are proportional to changes in abundance. However, little research has tested the performance of delta-models for estimating “scale”; that is, whether abundance indices are not just proportional to population changes but also have the correct absolute value. We use data for twenty species in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as a factorial experiment conditioned on data for Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod to support five conclusions related to scale in spatio-temporal delta-models. First, we show that conventional (nonspatial) delta-models are surprisingly sensitive to the a priori choice of probability distribution for positive catches, where gamma and Tweedie models give similar scale estimates but other distributions generally differ. Second, these same distri­ butions also estimate widely different scales when using spatio-temporal delta-models, and the delta-gamma and Tweedie models provide similar scale to design-based indices. Third, model selection using marginal AIC often identifies the lognormal distribution as most parsimonious, despite it resulting in systematically higher abun­ dance than design-based indices for many species. Fourth, scale is sensitive to the spatial resolution (i.e., number of knots) used in fitting the spatio-temporal model when using a naïve “empirical Bayes” estimator, but less sensitive when applying an epsilon bias-correction estimator. Fifth, the factorial simulation experiment suggests that the Tweedie and delta-gamma distributions perform well even when applied to data simulated from an inverse-Gaussian or lognormal distribution, whereas the opposite is not true. We conclude that index scale is sensitive to delta-model specification, and we make five recommendations when using spatio-temporal deltamodels for index standardization: (1) apply the epsilon or other bias-correction methods to reduce sensitivity of index scale on spatio-temporal model resolution; either (2) compare the scale of delta-model indices with that of design-based indices when design-based indices are available or (3) use the delta-gamma or Tweedie distribution by default when design-based indices are not available; (4) do not assume that AIC will identify the model specification that results in the most appropriate scale; and (5) consider apparent mismatches in index scale depending upon whether an assessment model specifies or estimates the associated catchability coefficient and whether the design-based index is believed to measure total abundance for a fully-selected age or length-class.},

            Spatio-temporal models have become key tools for evaluating population trends and habitat usage. We developed a spatio-temporal modelling framework employing a combination of encounter/non-encounter, count, and biomass data collected by different monitoring programs (“combined data”). The three data types are predicted using a computationally efficient approximation to a compound Poisson-gamma process. We fitted spatio-temporal models to combined data for Gulf of Mexico (GOM) red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) for 2006–2014. These spatio-temporal models provided insights into GOM red snapper spatial distribution patterns, which we corroborated by comparing to past predictions generated using only encounter/non-encounter data. However, relying on biomass and count data in addition to encounter/non-encounter data also allowed us to reconstruct biomass trends for GOM red snapper and to examine patterns of distribution shifts and range expansion/contraction for this population for the first time. Moreover, combining multiple data types improved the precision of reconstructed population trends and some variables quantifying habitat usage. Finally, scenarios and simulation experiments conditioned upon red snapper data showed that the improvement in fitting to combined data is greater when biomass data for the study population are lacking for an entire subregion and, to a lesser extent, for an entire time period (e.g. in early years).},

The SURF index (SUpportive Role to Fishery ecosystems) for each prey species weights food web connectance by the importance of trophic connections, so that higher scores indicate a greater potential for indirect food web effects of forage fish fisheries. We show that the SURF index is less sensitive to choices on degree of taxonomic aggregation of analysis than typical connectance measures. Moreover, we show that SURF provides more robust predictions of which species have greatest effects on other food web components.

	abstract = {Implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) for forage fish requires methods to evaluate tradeoffs associated with competing management objectives that focus on supporting fishery yields or providing food for predators. We developed an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model of the U.S. Northwest Atlantic continental shelf (NWACS) for the period 1982–2013 to inform an EAFM for Atlantic Menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus. The model (with 61 trophic groups and 8 fishing fleets) was parameterized and fitted to time series using data from stock assessments, surveys, and literature. Fifty-year simulations evaluated how Atlantic Menhaden fishing mortality rates (F) influenced different ecosystem indicators, including population biomasses, fishery yields, prey-to-predator ratios, and the proportion of trophic groups that were positively or negatively affected. We quantified tradeoffs associated with a range of alternative ecosystem-based reference points for Atlantic Menhaden F and biomass (B), including F for maximum sustainable yield (FMSY), 0.5FMSY, proxies for current single-species F reference points, 75\% of virgin unfished biomass (B0), and 40\%B0. Striped Bass Morone saxatilis were most sensitive to increases in Atlantic Menhaden fishing, largely due to their strong dietary reliance on this prey species, but other higher-trophic-level groups (birds, highly migratory species, sharks, and marine mammals) were also negatively impacted. Other commercially important predators of Atlantic Menhaden (e.g., Bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix and Weakfish Cynoscion regalis) had moderate to negligible responses at the highest levels of Atlantic Menhaden F. The alternative reference points considered resulted in (1) variable Atlantic Menhaden biomasses (40–75\% of B0) and yields (54–100\% of MSY), (2) up to a 60\% decline in Striped Bass B and yield, (3) negative impacts on the B of ≤13\% of modeled groups, and (4) positive impacts on the B of ≤6\% of modeled groups. Simulations demonstrated the varied responses, potential winners and losers, and tradeoffs resulting from alternative management strategies for Atlantic Menhaden. These results and the NWACS model can help to advance an EAFM for Atlantic Menhaden and other fishes.Received April 4, 2017; accepted July 19, 2017},

	abstract = {Fisheries have reduced the abundances of large piscivores—such as gadids (cod, pollock, etc.) and tunas—in ecosystems around the world. Fisheries also target smaller species—such as herring, capelin, and sprat—that are important parts of the piscivores’ diets. It has been suggested that harvesting of these so-called forage fish will harm piscivores. Multispecies models used for fisheries assessments typically ignore important facets of fish community dynamics, such as individual-level bioenergetics and/or size structure. We test the effects of fishing for both forage fish and piscivores using a dynamic, multitrophic, size-structured, bioenergetics model of the Baltic Sea. In addition, we analyze historical patterns in piscivore-biomass declines and fishing mortalities of piscivores and forage fish using global fish-stock assessment data. Our community-dynamics model shows that piscivores benefit from harvesting of their forage fish when piscivore fishing mortality is high. With substantial harvesting of forage fish, the piscivores can withstand higher fishing mortality. On the other hand, when piscivore fishing mortality is low, piscivore biomass decreases with more fishing of the forage fish. In accordance with these predictions, our statistical analysis of global fisheries data shows a positive interaction between the fishing mortalities of forage-fish stocks and piscivore stocks on the strength of piscivore-biomass declines. While overfishing of forage fish must be prevented, our study shows that reducing fishing pressures on forage fish may have unwanted negative side effects on piscivores. In some cases, decreasing forage-fish exploitation could cause declines, or even collapses, of piscivore stocks.},

The role in which diverging signals in the coastwide bottom trawl survey may be contributing to assessment problems was explored here for 18 stocks in the region. Specifically, trends in total mortality (Z) estimated from catch curve analysis and a relative measure of the harvest rate (total catch/survey index; called relative F) were evaluated. Across stocks, relative F has declined over time, on average, since the mid-1990s, yet Z has not for many stocks. Weak positive or even negative correlations between relative F and Z resulted for 13 stocks. This diverging signal appears to be contributing to assessment model performance, as larger retrospective patterns (a measure of assessment uncertainty) occurred for stocks with negative correlations between relative F and Z. While a variety of mechanisms could be involved in these diverging signals, the available evidence suggests that unreported catch and/or increasing natural mortality likely play a role to varying degrees for each stock.},

US northeast continental shelf ecosystem, collected from the early 1970s to 2001. Frequency of occurrence of organisms in the diet across time was examined as an index of relative abundance. Other prey and sampling caveats were accounted for by
considering only those predators that met criteria such as adequate sample size, appropriate diet compositions, asymptotic stomach-prey curves, and relative constancy of all major prey groups comprising the diet. The geographic distribution of a suite of
benthic organisms found in the stomachs of predators was also examined. The benthic organisms focused on were ophiuroids, echinoids, holothuroideans, asteroids, octopods, stomatopods, cumaceans, pagurids, aphroditids, anthozoans, hydrozoans and
caprellids. Of these 12 prey groups, only 3 showed a decline over time based on evidence from multiple predator stomachs. Most benthic organisms exhibited non-negative trends in an index of relative abundance, and 2 showed an increase over the
time-series. Additionally, many of the organisms were widely distributed, with some concentrated more on Georges Bank and others more in the Gulf of Maine. Only 1 of 9 organisms showed a shift in distribution compared to studies from 50 yr earlier. I
conclude that at broad spatial and temporal scales, the routine and systematic sampling of fish stomachs can be a useful indirect method for inferring information about benthic communities on continental shelves.},

As part of this directive, criteria have been outlined for defining ecologically and biologically significant areas and marine protected areas. One of the first steps in identifying either is the development of an inventory of species’ spatial distributions and the identification of habitats used by different life history stages of these species. Many of these data have been gleaned from research vessel trawl surveys that only sample a slice of the ecosystem. Here, for the first time, food habits data collected from a trawl survey were integrated with the original trawl data to improve estimates of species richness, distribution, and habitat associations with the objective of providing additional information for an EAM. The inclusion of stomach content data increased the number and size range of species observed: its greatest value was in describing invertebrate and small finfish species richness. We found differences in the spatial patterns and the influence of environmental factors on species richness between stomach and trawl samples. We conclude that the addition of stomach data can en rich the de finition process for spatial management tools, adding dimensions that would otherwise be missed. This has important implications for EAM since we may not be using all of the resources at our disposal.},

Their intermediate sizes and characteristic caridoid escape responses lead to chronic underestimation when sampling at large spatial scales with either plankton nets or large trawl nets. Here, as discrete sampling units, we utilized individual fish diets (i.e. fish biosamplers) collected by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and Northeast Fisheries Science Center to examine abundance and location of these prey families over large spatial and temporal scales in the northeastern US shelf large ecosystem. We found these prey families to be important to a wide variety of both juvenile and adult demersal fishes from Cape Hatteras to the Scotian Shelf. Fish biosamplers further revealed significant spatial shifts in prey in early spring. Distributions of mysids and crangonids in fish diets shoaled significantly from February to March. Distributions of euphausiids and pandalids in fish diets shifted northward during March. Of multiple hypotheses for these shifts, prey migration is most strongly supported. Rather than only the classic ontogenetic shift from feeding on shrimp to piscivory, of the 25 identified diet shifts in fish predators, 12 shifts were toward increased shrimp feeding frequency with increasing body length.},

	abstract = {Forage fish species are key in the transfer of energy from lower to upper trophic levels in marine ecosystems. Therefore, understanding their population dynamics, including population levels, is crucial for understanding productivity and the regulation of marine food webs. However, many forage fishes are poorly sampled by bottom trawl surveys, leading to poor estimates of their abundance. These estimates can be improved by using predator stomachs contents as an additional sampling strategy; however, nonlinear relationships between prey abundance and predator consumption (i.e. the functional response) may bias stomachs data as well. Using predator stomachs contents and bottom trawl survey data, this study aimed to minimize this bias by developing a model to estimate prey dynamics and account for the predator functional response. This model was tested using a series of simulations and applied to a case study of northern sand lance Ammodytes dubius on the Grand Bank, Newfoundland, Canada. The simulations revealed that when predators consumed prey following a nonlinear functional response, our model outperformed a classical model (the model adopted by most studies) that assumed a linear functional response. In the case study, we estimated the relative abundance of sand lance from 1995 to 2018, which exhibited oscillatory dynamics with a period of approximately 7 years. Our results demonstrate that our model is capable of more accurately estimating the abundance of data-limited prey populations, which contributes to a better understanding of food web dynamics.},

In the Western Gulf of Alaska (WGoA) and Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) ecosystems, three species of puffin (tufted and horned puffin, Fratercula cirrhata, Fratercula corniculata, and rhinoceros auklet, Cerorhinca monocerata, Alcidae), regularly prey upon (i.e., “sample”) age-0 groundfish, including walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogramma, Gadidae) and Pacific cod (Gadus microcephalus, Gadidae). Here, we test the hypothesis that integrating puffin dietary data with walleye pollock stock assessment data provides information useful for fisheries management, including indices of interannual variation in age-0 abundance and growth. To test this hypothesis, we conducted cross-correlation and regression analyses of puffin-based indices and spawning stock biomass (SSB) for the WGoA and EBS walleye pollock stocks. For the WGoA, SSB leads the abundance of age-0 fish in the puffin diet, indicating that puffins sample the downstream production of the WGoA spawning stock. By contrast, the abundance and growth of age-0 fish sampled by puffins lead SSB for the EBS stock by 1–3 years, indicating that the puffin diet proxies incoming year class strength for this stock. Our study indicates connectivity between the WGoA and EBS walleye pollock stocks. Integration of non-traditional data sources, such as seabird diet data, with stock assessment data appears useful to inform information gaps important for managing US fisheries in the North Pacific.},

We examined multispecies functional responses of 17 fishes (48 predator-size combinations) spanning piscivores, planktivores and benthivores for the northeast US continental shelf. Similar to previous work, linear relationships between predation and prey density (Holling type I response) were not supported, since model estimates of handling time were greater than zero for the prey considered. Instead, a clear majority of the predators sampled were Holling type III feeders (sigmoidal; prey switching or learning). For piscivores, nearly all responses were Holling type III with the exception of one being Holling type II (hyperbolic; satiation). Planktivores and benthivores exhibited a combination of type IV (feeding confusion at high prey density) and Holling type III responses. The relationships were predator- and prey-dependent, which is counter to assumptions that are often made of trophic groups. Decreased predation at high prey densities (type IV response) present among planktivores and benthivores suggests an overestimation of predation can occur if ignored. This contrasts with fish and squid prey which primarily invoked a Holling type III response. Functional responses are key to modelling trophic interactions for multispecies and ecosystem models. By refining these inputs in a multispecies context with empirical data, we can advance our understanding of whole-shelf ecology and improve decision-making tools for resource management.},

Juvenile rockfish (young-of-the-year Sebastes spp.) compose a significant part of the diet for many predators in the central California Current, including chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and several species of marine birds and mammals. Herein, we develop annual indices of juvenile rockfish relative abundance by collating time series data sets on: (i) the proportion of rockfish in the diet of three species of seabirds breeding on Southeast Farallon Island (1975–2002); (ii) the number of rockfish in chinook salmon stomachs (1980–99); and (iii) the abundance of rockfish captured in scientific mid-water trawl net surveys (1983–2002). We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to combine indices, and refer to these as ‘Multivariate Rockfish Indices’ (MRI). Combining time series verifies the patterns shown by each alone and provides a synoptic perspective on juvenile rockfish relative abundance. The diets of predators with the largest foraging ranges (Common Murre, Uria aalge) and chinook salmon co-varied strongly with the net samples, and appear to be the best indicators. The salmon also sampled species of Sebastes not caught in the nets. The MRI reveals interannual variability in juvenile rockfish abundance, a substantial decline in abundance in the 1990s, and a partial recovery in the early 2000s. Predator-based sampling is a cost-effective enhancement of scientific net sampling.},

	abstract = {In 2012, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council adopted a consumption-based stock assessment method to determine catch limits for the non-target, multi-species octopus complex in the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands (BSAI) fishery management area. The method uses Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) diet data as a basis for estimating octopus complex natural mortality and minimum biomass. To enhance understanding of the predator-prey interaction between Pacific cod and octopus, we examined patterns of octopus consumption by Pacific cod using long-term stomach contents data from the eastern Bering Sea continental shelf, a large, ecologically unique subarea of the BSAI. Generalized additive modeling of octopus presence/absence in Pacific cod diets revealed distinct spatial, ontogenetic and seasonal consumption patterns. Prey octopus frequency of occurrence (FO) generally increased with bottom depth, latitude and Pacific cod fork length, and FO in the southern BSAI was lower during winter and spring than during summer. Prey octopus FO patterns may reflect overall consumption patterns and likely indicate long-term distribution patterns of small-sized ({\textless}1 kg) octopus on the EBS shelf, although we could not visually distinguish between octopus species using prey remains. Multi-species beak length-to-body mass regressions developed from three octopus species allowed reasonable estimation of prey octopus mass, and we found Pacific cod fork length was positively correlated with prey octopus mass, suggesting predator-prey interactions are sensitive to predator and prey size composition. Pacific cod consumed octopus with estimated masses ranging from 0.000017 kg to 4.62 kg, while octopus taken during concurrent bottom trawl surveys range from 0.05 kg to greater than 25 kg. Based on our findings, we expect the consumption-based stock assessment underestimates BSAI octopus complex biomass because it cannot account for larger octopus, such as the 10–20 kg Enteroctopus dofleini which dominate incidental take in BSAI Pacific cod pot fishery.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a direct relationship between the amount of prey (capelin, Mallotus villosus) in its predators' stomachs (Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua) and the biomass of the prey in the same localities. The relationship at a local scale implies that predator stomach contents can be used to estimate prey distribution. There is no evidence for either (1) a negative effect of local predator abundance on stomach contents (expected if local prey depletion and/or feeding interference occurs when predator density is high) or (2) a negative effect of the amount of other food in cod stomachs on the amount of capelin in the stomachs (expected if prey switching occurs). There is a negative effect of bottom depth on amount of capelin in cod stomachs as expected, since capelin are pelagic and cod are primarily bottom-dwelling, resulting in less vertical overlap between the species in deep water. This type of analysis may be useful in other predator–prey systems. Simultaneous stomach samples and independent biomass estimates of the prey are required, but once the model is built, it permits estimation of prey distribution in places and times when no direct survey of the prey can be done.},
