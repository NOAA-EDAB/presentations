The MAFMC uses ecosystem indicators within a comprehensive risk assessment to identify fisheries and issues needing further evaluation. We review MAFMC's 2024 update to the risk assessment, along with the evolution of regional ecosystem reporting to characterize distribution, timing, and productivity shifts and their drivers. 

Main points

"Operational" means in use or ready for use

"Operationalizing" is an iterative process, especially the using part

Components of an operational process:

*  Clear articulation of management objectives (use)

*  Standardized information updates and reporting (we spend a lot of time on this, understand that operational processes require a lot of time and resources and are *not* research)

*  Feedbacks from the management system and adjustments to achieve management objectives

Mid Atlantic operational use of ecosystem information

*  Stock assessments (ESPs-->assessment structure; ecosystem covariates-->OFL projections)

*  ABC setting (data quality, model performance, and ecosystem information-->OFL CV-->ABC)

*  EAFM risk assessment (ecosystem information-->prioritize scoping and MSE)

In development, research coordinated with SSC

*  Ecosystem overfishing thresholds

Focus on the risk assessment and its operational use, process to bring new science in

Where to even start with ecosystem information can be daunting

*  MAFMC developed an EAFM process with specific objectives to integrate ecosystem information into its current management system

*  Risk assessment mainly based on ecosystem indicators in annual reports, updated annually

*  Risk assessment used to prioritize fishery for further investigation

How has it changed?

*  Static indicators --> dynamic, interest in prey availability, predation pressure, and offshore habitat change

*  Specific cross-sectoral impacts --> offshore wind impacts on biology and ecosystem as well as fishery access and scientific sampling

How is ecosystem reporting evolving to address management risks?

*  Formerly reported a list of climate indicators

*  New focus on management risks --> spatial management (distribution shifts), seasonal management (timing shifts), quota setting and rebuilding (productivity shifts)
