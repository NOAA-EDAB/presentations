# Operational: **in use or ready for use**  

Components of an operational process:

*  Clear articulation of management objectives (use)

*  Standardized information updates on a regular reporting schedule

*  Feedbacks from the management system and adjustments to achieve management objectives

"Operationalizing" is an iterative process within a specific context

The Councilâ€™s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop on slide 2. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).

Council and Advisory Panel members recommended new elements addressing human dimensions (recreational access equity), new elements addressing cross-sectoral impacts (offshore wind impacts on biology and ecosystem as well as fishery access and scientific sampling), and transitions from static ecosystem indicators to time series indicators (prey availability, predation pressure, and fishing community vulnerability). New ecosystem science was required to support these requests. The process included development of new indicators of prey availability based on spatio-temporal modeling using ecological datasets (stomach contents, zooplankton), and new spatial analyses of habitat, revenue, and surveys relative to wind energy development areas. Development of potential risk criteria is ongoing; thresholds between low, moderate, and high risk that are essential to operational use are developed collaboratively with Council and Advisory Panel members. 

The slide shows a higher risk example (black sea bass, low recent condition correlated with recently declining prey) and a lower risk example (bluefish, despite a long term decline in forage fish prey. recent condition has been good)

## How to get the OFL CV? Characterizing scientific uncertainty

.pull-left-40[
**SSC evaluates 6 criteria**

1. Data quality (Tier 1)
1. Model appropriateness (Tier 1)
1. Retrospective analysis (Tier 1)
1. Comparison with simpler analysis (Tier 2)
1. Ecosystem factors (Tier 2)
1. Recruitment trends (Tier 2)
]

.pull-right-60[

**5. Informed by ecosystem factors or comparisons with other species**  

.contrib[
a. Ecosystem factors considered may reduce or increase uncertainty; simply
considering an ecosystem factor does not automatically decrease uncertainty;

b. Stock-relevant ecosystem factors directly included in the assessment model, e.g.,:
  +  Environmentally dependent growth or other population processes;
  +  Environmentally dependent availability or other observation processes;
  +  Factors limiting/enhancing stock productivity (habitat quality, etc.);
  +  Predation, disease, or episodic environmental mortality (e.g., red tide);
  +  Time varying inputs such as empirical weight at age or stanzas of growth not
explicitly tied to ecosystem factors are considered under criterion #2, not
here. Stanzas of recruitment not explicitly tied to ecosystem factors are
considered under criterion #6;

c. Ecosystem factors outside the stock assessment affecting short term prediction can
inform uncertainty, e.g.,:
  +  General measures of ecosystem productivity and habitat stability (e.g.,
primary production amount and timing, temperature trends, and other
MAFMC EAFM risk assessment indicators at the stock or ecosystem level);
  +  Climate vulnerability or other risk assessment evaluation of potential for
changing productivity under changing conditions;
  +  Acute ecosystem events potentially affecting stock dynamics across the stock
range over the short term (e.g., marine heat waves, acidification or hypoxia
events, harmful algal blooms);

d. Comparisons among related species; e.g., recruitment, growth, condition patterns
across Mid Atlantic fish species that are: stable (low uncertainty), varying
synchronously (supports common environmental driver, lower uncertainty), or
varying unpredictably (higher uncertainty).
