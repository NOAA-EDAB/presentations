# Operational: **in use or ready for use**  

Components of an operational process:

*  Clear articulation of management objectives (use)

*  Standardized information updates on a regular reporting schedule

*  Feedbacks from the management system and adjustments to achieve management objectives

"Operationalizing" is an iterative process, especially the using part

???
(we spend a lot of time on this, understand that operational processes require a lot of time and resources and are *not* research)

# Mid Atlantic operational use of ecosystem information

.pull-left-60[

*  Stock assessments

*  ABC setting

*  EAFM risk assessment

*  Co-evoluation of ecosystem reporting and operational use

.pull-right-40[]

???
*  Stock assessments (ESPs-->assessment structure; ecosystem covariates-->OFL projections)

*  ABC setting (data quality, model performance, and ecosystem information-->OFL CV-->ABC)

*  EAFM risk assessment (ecosystem information-->prioritize scoping and MSE)

In development, research coordinated with SSC

*  Ecosystem overfishing thresholds

Focus on the risk assessment and its operational use, process to bring new science in

## How to get the OFL CV? Characterizing scientific uncertainty

.pull-left-40[
**SSC evaluates 6 criteria**

1. Data quality (Tier 1)
1. Model appropriateness (Tier 1)
1. Retrospective analysis (Tier 1)
1. Comparison with simpler analysis (Tier 2)
1. Ecosystem factors (Tier 2)
1. Recruitment trends (Tier 2)
]

.pull-right-60[

**5. Informed by ecosystem factors or comparisons with other species**  

.contrib[
a. Ecosystem factors considered may reduce or increase uncertainty; simply
considering an ecosystem factor does not automatically decrease uncertainty;

b. Stock-relevant ecosystem factors directly included in the assessment model, e.g.,:
  +  Environmentally dependent growth or other population processes;
  +  Environmentally dependent availability or other observation processes;
  +  Factors limiting/enhancing stock productivity (habitat quality, etc.);
  +  Predation, disease, or episodic environmental mortality (e.g., red tide);
  +  Time varying inputs such as empirical weight at age or stanzas of growth not
explicitly tied to ecosystem factors are considered under criterion #2, not
here. Stanzas of recruitment not explicitly tied to ecosystem factors are
considered under criterion #6;

c. Ecosystem factors outside the stock assessment affecting short term prediction can
inform uncertainty, e.g.,:
  +  General measures of ecosystem productivity and habitat stability (e.g.,
primary production amount and timing, temperature trends, and other
MAFMC EAFM risk assessment indicators at the stock or ecosystem level);
  +  Climate vulnerability or other risk assessment evaluation of potential for
changing productivity under changing conditions;
  +  Acute ecosystem events potentially affecting stock dynamics across the stock
range over the short term (e.g., marine heat waves, acidification or hypoxia
events, harmful algal blooms);

d. Comparisons among related species; e.g., recruitment, growth, condition patterns
across Mid Atlantic fish species that are: stable (low uncertainty), varying
synchronously (supports common environmental driver, lower uncertainty), or
varying unpredictably (higher uncertainty).
