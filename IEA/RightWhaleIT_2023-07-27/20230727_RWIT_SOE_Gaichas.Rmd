## Goal: include climate and ecosystem information in management decision processes

.pull-left[
*Overview*
- What types of decisions are made?

    * Single species catch limits
    * Allocations to fleets or areas
    * Coordination across boundaries and sectors 
    * Multispecies and ecosystem level tradeoffs

- How can ecosystem information support these decisions? 

    * Key tools: ecosystem reporting, risk assessment, scenario planning, managment strategy evaluation
    * Developing decision processes along with products

## Background: Federal fishery management in the US

Eight regional Fishery Management Councils establish plans for sustainable management of stocks within their jurisdictions. All are governed by the same law, but tailor management to their regional stakeholder needs.

## Ecosystem synthesis themes

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

*  Different development impacts for species preferring soft bottom vs. hard bottom

Implications: 

* Currently meeting objectives, but recent bycatch uncertain.

* Risk element: TechInteract, evaluated by species and sector:  14 <span style="background-color:lightgreen;">low</span>, 6 <span style="background-color:yellow;">low-mod</span>, 3 <span style="background-color:orange;">mod-high</span> risk, unchanged

* The downward trend in harbor porpoise bycatch can also be due to a decrease in harbor porpoise abundance in US waters, reducing their overlap with fisheries, and a decrease in gillnet effort. 

* The increasing trend in gray seal bycatch may be related to an increase in the gray seal population (U.S. pup counts).

Implications:  

* Population drivers for North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW) include combined fishery interactions/ship strikes, distribution shifts, and copepod availability. 

* Additional potential stressors include offshore wind development, which overlaps with important habitat areas used year-round by right whales, including mother and calf migration corridors and foraging habitat.

* Unusual mortality events continue for 3 large whale species.

* Risk elements:

Seasonal sea surface temperatures in 2022 were above average for most of the year,  however late spring storms caused deep mixing, which delayed stratification and surface warming in late spring and early summer. A combination of long-term ocean warming and extreme events should be used to assess total heat stress on marine organisms

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development Summary

.pull-left[
Implications: 
*  1-34% of port revenue from fisheries currently comes from areas proposed for offshore wind development. Some communities have environmental justice concerns and gentrification vulnerability.
*  Up to 17% of annual commercial landings and revenue for Mid-Atlantic species occur in lease areas.
*  Development will affect species differently, negatively affecting species that prefer soft bottom habitat while potentially benefiting species that prefer hard structured habitat.
*  Planned wind areas overlap with important right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.

The Bluefish Research Track ESP was presented December 7 2022, and was well received by CIE reviewers. Reviewers commented that it was the most complete treatment of a stock assessment "ecosystem ToR" they had seen, and formed a good basis for integrating further ecosystem information into the stock assessment in the future. The full ESP document is available as a working paper from the [stock assessment data portal](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/saw/sasi_files.php?year=2022&species_id=32&stock_id=6&review_type_id=5&info_type_id=5&map_type_id=&filename=WP%2001%20Tyrell%20etAl%202022%20-%20ESP.pdf). 

In addition to the conceptual model, a summary table was developed for bluefish ecosystem indicators. This type of summary could contribute to OFL CV decisions with further information on how these indicator levels affect uncertainty in assessment.

Our ESP process was developed from the AFSC process, but we adjusted things slightly because of how our benchmarks are scheduled and because we are providing scientific advice to multiple Councils. 

The ESP framework is an iterative cycle that complements the stock assessment cycle. First I will give you an overview of the ESP cycle, and then I will explain each step in more detail. The ESP begins with the development of the problem statement by identifying the topics that the assessment working group and ESP team want to assess. This process includes a literature review or other method of gathering existing information on the stock, such as reviewing prior assessments and research recommendations. Next, a conceptual model is created that links important processes and pressures to stock performance. From these linkages, we develop indicators that can be used to monitor the system conditions. Next, the indicators are analyzed to determine their status and the likely impacts on the stock. Some indicators may be tested for inclusion in assessment models. Finally, all of these analyses are synthesized into a report card to provide general recommendations for fishery management.
