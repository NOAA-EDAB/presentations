## Mission Statement

![poseidon](EDAB_images/poseidon-1024x6391.jpg)

## Mission Statement

> The Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch consists of an interdisciplinary group of researchers with backgrounds in fisheries science, oceanography, and climate science. We use open-science principles to develop and apply ecosystem and statistical models to integrate information on biological, climate, oceanographic, and human-related activities to evaluate the effects on ecosystem structure and function. We work collaboratively across the Center and with a broad suite of partners to synthesize ecosystem information to inform living-marine resource management and support ecosystem-based fisheries management in the Northeast United States.
