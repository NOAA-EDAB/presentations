## Ecosystem synthesis themes

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** — large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

Summer aragonite saturation low for both Atlantic sea scallop and longfin squid in Long Island Sound and the nearshore and mid-shelf regions of the New Jersey shelf several times over the past decade.

There were fewer warm core rings near the continental shelf in 2022, which combined with economic fishery drivers may have contributed to total catch of *Illex* squid being 20% less than the total catch reported in 2021.

   * Conceptual model links across risk elements for fisheries, species
   * Management strategy evaluation includes key risks

]
???
The Council’s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

Comments on overall risk assessment for EOP to consider?

## SOE use in management: MAFMC

* Based on risk assessment, the Council selected summer flounder as high-risk fishery for conceptual modeling

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).

## What is Management Strategy Evaluation?

- Process to develop fishery management procedures  

- First used in S. Africa, Australia, and at International Whaling Commission  late 1980s - early 1990s

>Under this approach, management advice is based on a fully specified set of rules that have been tested in simulations of a wide variety of scenarios that specifically take uncertainty into account. The full procedure includes specifications for the data to be collected and how those data are to be used to provide management advice, in a manner that incorporates a feedback mechanism. `r Cite(myBib, "punt_developing_2007")`

## How might fishery managers use OA information in the future?

.pull-left[
*Species level decisions*

+ MAFMC includes climate vulnerability in scientific uncertainty considerations for establishing Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC)
+ OA sensitivity is included in climate vulnerability
+ OA sensitivity thresholds for individual species in 2022-2023 SOE
+ With full region OA reporting, potential to consider in stock assessment

*System level decisions*

+ Habitat climate vulnerability assessment recently completed
+ With full region OA reporting, OA could be included in
    + Ecosystem and habitat assessments
    + Multispecies metabolic indices
]

.pull-right[
Focus on developing *decision processes* that are able to use OA information

*  Collaborative, iterative process between scientists, managers, stakeholders
*  Ecosystem reporting, risk and vulnerability assessment useful tools
*  Multispecies and system level indicators of productivity change
