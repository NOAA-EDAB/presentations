# What do *you* think EBFM means?
]

---
# US Policy defines EBFM as:

## A systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals.

## What is ecosystem information? 

An *indicator* tells us something about where we are relative to our goals or to limits, or about the context we are working within that may affect achieving our goals.

A quick definition of ecosystem indicators, why they’re useful, and broad categories (e.g. climate, oceanographic, habitat, primary productivity, ecosystem services, human dimensions, etc.)

Other vehicles (e.g., some regions that don’t yet have regular ESRs have mentioned SAFE reports, fishery performance reports, and others). *Don’t worry about being comprehensive here – in the discussion that follows this talk we’ll be asking people how they receive ecosystem information.

???
The Council’s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop on slide 2. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

## How is MAFMC using the risk assessment?

* Risk based prioritization: the Council selected summer flounder for [conceptual modeling](https://nefsc.github.io/READ-SSB-DePiper_Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html)

* Council completed management strategy evaluation (MSE) addressing [recreational fishery discards](https://www.mafmc.org/actions/summer-flounder-mse) based on conceptual modeling

* Stakeholder driven MSE coupled population and recreational demand models

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).
