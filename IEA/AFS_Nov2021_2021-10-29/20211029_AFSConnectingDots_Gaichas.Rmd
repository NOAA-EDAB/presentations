## Talk outline:


* Background on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) 
* MAFMC [strategic plan](https://www.mafmc.org/strategic-plan) prioritizes “development of ecosystem approaches that are responsive to the effects of climate change”
* MAFMC's [Ecosystem Approach to Fishery Management](https://www.mafmc.org/eafm) (EAFM) process integrates climate with other Council concerns and priorities
* [Ecosystem reporting](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/state-ecosystem-reports-northeast-us-shelf): one stop shopping for current conditions and recent research, presented annually and used to update risk assessment--evolving to better meet Council needs. 
* Current/future: [East coast climate scenario planning](https://www.mafmc.org/climate-change-scenario-planning), [NOAA Climate Fisheries Initiative](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/climate-change#noaa-climate-and-fisheries-initiative) for forecasts
* Success hinges on collaboration, stakeholder engagement throughout, learning by doing

EAFM approach
   * Climate in risk assessment--uses NCVA, distribution shifts separate element
   * Climate in conceptual model--links across risk elements for individual species
   * Climate in MSE? Indirect, but not off the table (unlike “traditional” MSE)
Ecosystem reporting
   * Climate a central theme in 2021 in response to Council request
   * More effort to connect climate attributes with species outcomes to refine risk assessment
   * Habitat climate vulnerability introduced with links to species
   * All will be used to further refine the risk assessment
   * Currently working on how to use in SSC decisions like OFL CV → ABC

## How did MAFMC develop their ecosystem approach?

Visioning Project &rarr; [Strategic Plan](https://www.mafmc.org/strategic-plan) that developed the 2016 Ecosystem Approach to Fishery Management (EAFM) Policy Guidance document:
http://www.mafmc.org/s/EAFM-Doc-Revised-2019-02-08.pdf
>"A non-regulatory umbrella document intended to guide Council policy with respect to ecosystem considerations across existing Fishery Management Plans"

.center[
![:img Mid-Atlantic EAFM development with full details in speaker notes, 60%](EDAB_images/MAapproach.png)
]

Details, including workshop presentations and white papers: http://www.mafmc.org/eafm

???
The Mid-Atlantic Council identified several theme areas from the visioning project as noted in the left panel of the workflow graphic: forage fish, species interactions, social and economic issues, climate and habitat. The Council held full day workshops during Council meetings where experts on the topics provided overviews and Council members asked questions and discussed the issues. Workships on Forage fish, Climate, Climate and Governance, Interactions (species and fleet), and Habitat were held between 2013 and 2015, resulting in white papers on Forage fish, Climate (and habitat), Interactions (species, fleet, climate, and habitat). Social and economic considerations were integrated in each workshop rather than looked at separately.

   * Climate in conceptual model linking across risk elements for individual species
.footnote[
https://www.mafmc.org/eafm
]
]
???
The Council’s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

A marine heatwave is a warming event that lasts for five or more days with sea surface temperatures above the 90th percentile of the  historical daily climatology (1982-2011).

Changes:
Butterfish B status risk increased from lowest to low-mod (below Bmsy)
Allocation risk decreased for 4 fisheries from high to low (intermediate rankings not applied)
Black sea bass regulatory complexity risk decreased from highest to moderate-high

Potential new indicators from new SOE sections on climate risk, habitat vulnerability, offshore wind

Habitat vulnerability analysis writeups--comments?

## How is MAFMC using the risk assessment? What's next?
.pull-left[
* Based on risk assessment, the Council selected summer flounder as high-risk fishery for conceptual modeling

![:img Mid-Atlantic EAFM framework, 95%](EDAB_images/Framework.png)
]
.pull-right[
* Working group of habitat, biology, stock assessment, management, economic and social scientists developed:

  * draft conceptual models of high risk elements, linkages
  * dataset identification and gap analysis for each element and link
  * draft questions that the Council could persue with additional work
 
* Final conceptual model and supporting information at December 2019 Council meeting
] 

* Council proceeding with management strategy evaluation (MSE) using the information from conceptual modeling as a basis. Topic: addressing recreational fishery discards with EAFM

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).

A Climate Fisheries Initiative within NOAA aims to improve regional ocean modeling capabilities and develop interdisciplinary communities of practice--including managers--that will be essential to operational ecological forecasts. Finally, the iterative, collaborative IEA process itself provides opportunities to prioritize which ecological forecasts to develop.

# Collaboration is key!

* Within the science community – diverse expertise is needed  
* Between science and management – understanding what information is needed and important to management, providing tools to management to understand ecosystem linkages and implications  
* Between science and stakeholders – need to build trust, open dialogue (everyone is heard), and sharing data and observations (on water and with information)  
* Between management and stakeholders – listening to/acting on stakeholder priorities and feedback, process not out to add more uncertainty but provide for more informed decisions
