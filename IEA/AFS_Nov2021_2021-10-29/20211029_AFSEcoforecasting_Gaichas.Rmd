* Integrated Ecosystem Assessment: what is it? (loop plus illustrative examples)
* Where would ecological forecasts fit in the loop? (example--statistical bottom temp)
* How do we get there?
   * IEA: Work with managers to determine highest priority forecasts
   * Research connecting physics-fishery outcomes through complex pathways (examples--BSB habitat forecasts based on multiple attributes)
   * Climate Fisheries Initiative (regional modeling capability--very needed in NE US where global model skill is poor!)

???
Integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) is a collaborative process between managers, scientists, and stakeholders that uses multiple analyses and decision support tools to provide scientific advice for ecosystem-based management. The process begins with the definition of goals and objectives for management, then identifies information and indicators associated with these goals and objectives. Assessment of indicators relative to historical baselines or management thresholds gives information on current performance--status and trends--relative to management objectives. Indicators can also be used within risk assessment frameworks to identify and mitigate risks to meeting objectives. Indicator based assessments and risk analyses can also inform simulation-based management strategy evaluations that characterize potential performance of alternative management actions and tradeoffs between objectives associated with those actions. We illustrate the use of IEA in fisheries management with examples from the Northeast US.

## Where would ecological forecasts fit?

???
While ecological forecasts would be extremely useful in IEA, current applications mainly rely on historical indicator trends because few marine fisheries ecological forecasts exist. The most useful ecological forecasts for fisheries management may be among the most difficult to achieve: seasonal to decadal ecological forecasts of multiple system attributes in particular regions. 
---

## How do we get there?

Example management applications of ecological forecasts in the remainder of the presentation
???
However, process-based research connecting biophysical variables to managed species physiology and population dynamics is in progress. Further, both statistical and dynamical forecasts of marine habitat are in development. A Climate Fisheries Initiative within NOAA aims to improve regional ocean modeling capabilities and develop interdisciplinary communities of practice--including managers--that will be essential to operational ecological forecasts. Finally, the iterative, collaborative IEA process itself provides opportunities to prioritize which ecological forecasts to develop.

Objectives: (1) coordinate to synthesize results of various ongoing and completed climate change research projects; (2) evaluate the scope of impacts on priority species identified in initial studies; and (3) strategically revaluate management strategies every 5-7 years; (4) include synthesis to evaluate climate-resilient management tools. The climate change Action Module team will work with the Council to iteratively identify and assess the performance of potential short-term, medium and long-term management actions for climate adaptation (i.e., derive alternative strategies for MSEs).
