## Engagement improving State of the Ecosystem (SOE) Reporting: Context for busy people

*"So what?" --John Boreman, September 2016*

1. Clear linkage of ecosystem indicators with management objectives

1. Synthesis across indicators for big picture

1. Objectives related to management objectives being placed first in report

1. Short (< 40 pages), non-technical (but rigorous) text

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 


???
In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model
Many indicators presented at WGNARS, used in larger Ecosystem Status reports
Shorter, fishery specific State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report with conceptual models prototyped based on California Current reporting
Feedback from fishery managers redesigned reporting to align with objectives outlined by WGNARS

## Engagement: Why develop an ecosystem approach?

*"We rebuilt all the stocks, so why is everyone still pissed off?" --Rich Seagraves*

in 2011, the Mid-Atlantic Council asked:

.pull-left[
![visioning project goals and objectives](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/raw/master/docs/EDAB_images/MA_Visioning1.png)
]
.pull-right[
![visioning project responses and port meetings](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/raw/master/docs/EDAB_images/MA_Visioning2.png)
]

And many people answered, from commercial fishery, recreational fishery, environmental organization, and interested public perspectives.

Visioning report: 

http://www.mafmc.org/s/MAFMC-stakeholder-input-report-p7b9.pdf

---
## Common themes among all stakeholder groups:

>• There is a lack of confidence in the data that drive fishery management decisions.
>
>• Stakeholders are not as involved in the Council process as they can and should be.
>
>• Different jurisdictions and regulations among the many fishery management organizations result in complexity and inconsistency.
>
>• There is a need for increased transparency and communications in fisheries management.
>
>• The dynamics of the ecosystem and food web should be considered to a greater extent in fisheries management decisions.
>
>• Stakeholders are not adequately represented on the Council.
>
>• Pollution is negatively affecting the health of fish stocks.

## How did MAFMC develop their ecosystem approach?

Visioning Project &rarr; Strategic Plan with one objective to develop 
>"A non-regulatory umbrella document intended to guide Council policy with respect to ecosystem considerations across existing Fishery Management Plans"

.center[
![:img Mid-Atlantic EAFM development with full details in speaker notes, 60%](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/raw/master/docs/EDAB_images/MAapproach.png)
]

Details, including workshop presentations and white papers: http://www.mafmc.org/eafm

???
The Mid-Atlantic Council identified several theme areas from the visioning project as noted in the left panel of the workflow graphic: forage fish, species interactions, social and economic issues, climate and habitat. The Council held full day workshops during Council meetings where experts on the topics provided overviews and Council members asked questions and discussed the issues. Workships on Forage fish, Climate, Climate and Governance, Interactions (species and fleet), and Habitat were held between 2013 and 2015, resulting in white papers on Forage fish, Climate (and habitat), Interactions (species, fleet, climate, and habitat). Social and economic considerations were integrated in each workshop rather than looked at separately.

![:img Mid-Atlantic EAFM framework with full details in speaker notes, 60%](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/raw/master/docs/EDAB_images/Framework.png)
]


???
The Council’s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop on slide 2. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

Risk assessment highlights prority species/issues for more detailed evaluation

A conceptual model maps out key interactions for high risk fisheries, specifies quantitative management strategy evaluation

]


???
Quoted from [Gaichas et al 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2016.00105/full)
For this example, the [existing Mid Atlantic food web model](https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/conceptual-models.html) is used to define key species interactions for each managed species, habitat expertise is needed to link habitats to species, physical oceanographic and climate expertise is needed to link key climate drivers to habitats, and the expertise of fishermen, economists and other social scientists, and fishery managers is needed to link fish with fisheries and objectives for human well-being. The key link between fisheries and human well being objectives is identified as the system of regulatory allocations of total allowable catch between states along the Mid Atlantic coast. The interaction between this allocation system (based on historical catch) and climate-driven distribution shifts of the managed species has created considerable difficulty in this region. This conceptual model clearly connects climate considerations to management, as well as habitat considerations of concern to the Council but outside Council jurisdiction (water quality in coastal estuaries).

## Engagement 4: Stakeholder engagement for Management Strategy Evaluation

*Are any Atlantic herring harvest control rules good for both fisheries and predators?* 

.pull-left-30[
**Harvest control rules** are:
- plans for changing fishing based on stock status
- pre-determined
    
*"Which harvest control rules best consider herring's role as forage?"*
- DESIGN a harvest control rule (HCR):
    - balancing fishing benefits and ecological services
    - addressing diverse stakeholder interests
- TRANSPARENTLY within management time frame!

## The Herring MSE process
.pull-left-30[
*First MSE within US Council*  
`r Cite(myBib, "feeney_integrating_2019")`  
Scope: annual stockwide HCR
Open stakeholder meetings (2)
- ID objectives, uncertainties
- ID acceptable performance
- more diverse, interactive than "normal" process 

Uncertainties identified
- herring mortality (M)
- environmental effects on herring 
- predator response to herring abundance
- assessment uncertainty

The Dream:<sup>1</sup>
Convert the effects of control rules on 4 user groups to dollars:
.contrib[
1. Users of landed herring (Demand)
    - Lobster industry, aquariums
1. Herring harvesters (Supply)
1. Direct users of herring in the ocean (not people)
    - Terns and Whales
    -  Striped Bass, Dogfish
1. Indirect users of herring in the ocean (people, Derived Demand)
    - Bird- and whale-watchers
    - Recreational and Commercial Fishing
]
The Reality
.contrib[
- 8 herring operating models linked to simple predator and economic models, developed in parallel
- limited range of predator response
- limited economic effects, directed fishery only

## Governance: Fishery management in the US

Eight regional Fishery Management Councils establish plans for sustainable management of stocks within their jurisdictions. All are governed by the same law, but tailor management to their regional stakeholder needs.

## How to use the scenarios?

>Cross-Jurisdictional Management & Governance
>
>*    What major stresses would be placed on existing cross-jurisdictional (Council/Commission/State) governance arrangements in this scenario?  
*    Would current approaches for updating management authority over a fishery work well? Here, management authority refers to the entity (Council(s), Commission, or NOAA) responsible for developing the management plan.  
*    What mechanisms for changing management authority need to be considered? For example, automatic triggers based on changes in stock distribution?  
*    What management challenges are present for species that move across jurisdictional boundaries?  
*    What actions/changes are needed to better manage species that move across jurisdictional boundaries?

## Conclusions `r Cite(myBib, "muffley_there_2021")`

* The process takes time – need to recognize that early and be willing to invest the resources to see it through  
    + Need the science to develop and support efforts  
    + Need management (and stakeholders) to understand process and concepts and support process  
    
* Collaboration is key  
    + Within the science community – diverse expertise is needed  
    + Between science and management – understanding what information is needed and important to management, providing tools to management to understand ecosystem linkages and implications  
    + Between science and stakeholders – need to build trust, open dialogue (everyone is heard), and sharing data and observations (on water and with information)  
    + Between management and stakeholders – listening to/acting on stakeholder priorities and feedback, process not out to add more uncertainty but provide for more informed decisions 
    
* Timely and understandable scientific information
    + Developing a process to create science products at timescales necessary for management
    + Information needs to be relevant and clearly presented
    + Flexibility to use different/alternative data sources when specific data in not available (proxies)
