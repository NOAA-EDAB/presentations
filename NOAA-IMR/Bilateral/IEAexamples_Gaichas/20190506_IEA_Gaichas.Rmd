## State of the Ecosystem (SOE) Reporting: Context for busy people

*"So what?" --John Boreman, September 2016*

1. Clear linkage of ecosystem indicators with management objectives

1. Synthesis across indicators for big picture

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Short (< 30 pages), non-technical (but rigorous) text

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 

```{r nes-comp2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/nes-components-abstracted.png")

In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model

## SOE Orientation: Indicator visualization

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators** and plotted in a standardized way

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context<sup>1-3</sup>

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

Because we focus on ecosystem context, we've aggregated species in most of our indicators up to the level of feeding guild, shown here.

These feeding guilds were derived from NEFSC food habits data and existing guilds identified in the literature

## EAFM Risk Assessment update

The Mid-Atlantic Council requested that the State of the Ecosystem report indicators be used to annually update their EAFM risk assessment. Therefore, the ecosystem reporting now has a direct strategic use.

### Decreased Risk
* Summer flounder fishing mortality (F) status has improved from high risk (F>Fmsy) to low risk (F<Fmsy) based on the new benchmark assessment

* Updated commercial fleet diversity (fleet count and fleet diversity) have no long term trends, thus improving from moderate-high risk to low risk according to risk criteria for this element

### Increased Risk
* No indicators for individual elements have changed enough to warrant increased risk rankings according to the Council risk critiera (but see caveats regarding analyses that were not updated)

---
## EAFM Risk Assessment: Updated Risk Rankings
*Species level risk elements*
```{r sptable, fig.align="center",out.width="95%"}

## Mid-Atlantic Council Ecosystem Approach

* Based on risk assessment, the Council selected summer flounder as high-risk fishery for conceptual modeling

```{r framework2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/Framework.png")
```

* Working group of habitat, biology, stock assessment, management, economic and social scientists are now developing:

  * draft conceptual models of high risk elements, linkages
  * dataset identification and gap analysis for each element and link
  * draft questions that the Council could persue with additional work

---
## Mid-Atlantic Council Ecosystem Approach

* The late 2018 summer flounder conceptual model, now under construction:

```{r sfconceptmod, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/Summerfl_EAFM_v2.png")
```

* Final conceptual modeling to be done by late 2019

* Council may then elect to proceed with management strategy evaluation (MSE) using the information from conceptual modeling as a basis

---
## IEA footnote: Improvements to reproducibility and provenance

* Reporting the information is not enough

* Managers appreciate the concise format, but back-end critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing
  
![soe-data-flow](EDAB_images/soe-data-flow.png)  

???
This workflows also ensures that there's no information lost between SOE cycles. We know exactly how a data set was analyzed and handled so that the data can be updated for next year's reports.

## SOE 2019 Overview Results

```{r nes-comp1, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/nes-components.png")
```

???
The purpose of this report is to synthesize available information relevant to fishery management in the Mid-Atlantic portion of the US Northeast Shelf. This 2019 report highlights where management interventions have proven successful to achieve ecological objectives, but also characterizes the considerable challenges for management posed by climate change and increasing trade-offs across conservation, fishing, and other human activities in this region. Finally, we describe combinations of ecological signals that present opportunities for further integrated research and possibly creative management solutions.

## Good news: Management works (I)

Evidence suggests that management limiting nutrient inputs has significantly improved water quality in Chesapeake Bay

**Chesapeake Bay Water Quality**

```{r cb-water-qual, fig.height = 3.5, fig.align = "center"}

           linetype = hline.lty) +
  theme_ts() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14))
```


???
First indicator I'd like to talk about is a new water quality for Chesapeake Bay, which many resource species use as nursery habitat or are dependent upon (e.g. bluefish, striped bass, menhaden, black sea bass)

These data, which were provided by collaborators at the Chesapeake Bay Program, represent the percent of tidal waters in Chesapeake Bay meeting water quality standards for chlorophyll a, submerged aquatic vegetation, and dissolved oxygen. The increase in water quality for the Bay has been tied to management action limiting nutrient influx into the watershed, and improvments in dissolved oxygen and water clarity.

```


???
The maps here show density estimates of the widely distributed harbor porpoise in the spring and fall months, as estimated by the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species.

The red line in the time series plot shows the potential biological removal. Above this line removals from the population will prevent the stock from reaching a stable population size. 

2016 and 2017 estimates for bycacth are among the lowest values in the series, suggest that management actions have been effective in reducing harbor porpoise bycatch.

## Challenge: Unprecedented ecosystem observations

* Northeast US shelf is still among the fastest warming waters globally
  * 7/10 warmest years observed in the past decade
  
* Most northerly Gulf Stream north wall positions ever recorded 2014-2017 
  * associated with warmer ocean temperature in the Northeast US shelf

Advice for managing in the face of rapid, unprecedented ecosystem changes?

SST
Figure on left shows estimated time series of SST extending back to to 1850s. 
*7 out of 10 of the hottest years have been in the past decade

GSI
The figure on the right shows that deviation from the mean latitude of the north wall of the gulf stream, showing anomalously high value for the past 5 years

These things are important for managers to know about because they directly influence stock distribution dynamics

## Changing base of the food web: primary production
* Summer PP is increasing in the Mid-Atlantic (and in New England)
  * Driven by warmer temperatures and increased bacterial remineralization and nutrient recycling
  * Increasing primary production likely due to higher productivity of smaller phytoplankton

## Changing base of the food web
**Primary production and copepod size structure**

* Lower copepod size index means higher abundance of large copepods (<i>Calanus</i>)
* Primary production may play a role in zooplankton size dynamics on the shelf


```{r MAB-sli, fig.height = 5, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8}
source("R/sli_plots.R")
mab_out <- sli_plots("MAB")

mab_out[[1]] + mab_out[[2]] + plot_layout(ncol=1)
```

???
To assess the size structure of copepods in the region, we use the small-large index.
* A measure of relative size composition of the dominant copepod taxa
* A lower value means higher abundance of large copepods (<i>Calanus</i>)
* Primary production may play a role in copepod size dynamics***

## Changing base of the food web and fish conditions

* Fish condition is measured at the weight at a given length relative to the average
  * drop-off in condition around 2000 aligns with the shift in zooplankton size-structure on the shelf

*MAFMC Condition Factor*
```{r fish-con2, fig.align="center",out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/MAFMC_Fish_Condition_2019.jpg")
```


???
Looking at condition in aggregate across all managed stocks, we can see a clear decline in condition between 2000-2010

Recent improvement within past decade

Interestingly, the drop-off in condition around 2000 resembles a shift in zooplankton size-structure on the shelf, and this is a topic for future research

## Changing base of the food web and fish productivity

* During the 1990s and early 2000s, high relative abundance of smaller bodied copepods and a lower relative abundance of *Calanus finmarchicus* coincided with regime shifts to lower fish recruitment<sup>1</sup>

In the Mid, there seems to be a decline in productivity in recent years, due to changes in recruitment and survival. 

In the past 5 years, strong productivity years for witch flounder, silver hake, and winter flounder have driven increases
