# Project motivation

.pull-left[

- Changing climate and ocean conditions --> Shifting distributions, changing productivity

- Needs:
  - Improve our ability to project global change impacts in the California Current and Nordic/Barents Seas (and elsewhere)
  - Test the performance of stock assessments to these impacts

## End-to-end ecosystem operating models
.pull-left[
1. Scenarios for effects of temperature on growth, natural mortality

1. Focus on key stocks (Northeast Arctic cod, Norwegian spring spawning herring, California Current sardine, Pacific hake or a Pacific rockfish)

1. Atlantis output to dataset generator (`atlantisom`) -> Stock Synthesis assessment 

1. Also `atlantisom` -> multispecies, other single species models for testing

1. Compare performance of different model settings, multiple models, model ensembles

## What can we do so far?

Example results: 
.pull-left[
Survey census test NOBA 
```{r ex-output1, echo = F, warning = F, message=F, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/NOBAcensus.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
Standard survey test CCA
```{r ex-output2, echo = F, warning = F, message=F, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/CCsurveyex.png")
```

## REDUS to the rescue!

What level of uncertainty is appropriate to carry through these analyses?
.pull-left[
1. Survey specification:

    1. timing and spatial coverage?

    1. which species are captured?

    1. species-specific survey efficiency ("q")?

    1. selectivity at age for each species?

1. Survey uncertainty:

    1. additional observation error (survey cv for index)?
    
    1. effective sample size for biological samples?
] 
.pull-right[
1. Fishery uncertainty:
    
    1. additional observation error (catch cv for total)?
    
    1. catch sampled for length/age in all areas?
    
    1. effective sample size for biological samples?
