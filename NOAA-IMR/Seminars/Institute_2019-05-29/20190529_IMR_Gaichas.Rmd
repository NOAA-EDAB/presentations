## Conclusion

Rapid progress in implementing an ecosystem approach to fishery management resulted from positive collaboration between managers, stakeholders, and scientists. Collaboration is essential to integrated ecosystem assessment and to the success of ecosystem approaches.

## State of the Ecosystem (SOE) Reporting: Context for busy people

*"So what?" --John Boreman, September 2016*

1. Clear linkage of ecosystem indicators with management objectives

1. Synthesis across indicators for big picture

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Short (< 30 pages), non-technical (but rigorous) text

1. Emphasis on reproducibility

## SOE Orientation: Indicator visualization

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators** and plotted in a standardized way

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context<sup>1-3</sup>

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

Because we focus on ecosystem context, we've aggregated species in most of our indicators up to the level of feeding guild, shown here.

These feeding guilds were derived from NEFSC food habits data and existing guilds identified in the literature

## EAFM Risk Assessment update

The Mid-Atlantic Council requested that the State of the Ecosystem report indicators be used to annually update their EAFM risk assessment. Therefore, the ecosystem reporting now has a direct strategic use.

### Decreased Risk
* Summer flounder fishing mortality (F) status has improved from high risk (F>Fmsy) to low risk (F<Fmsy) based on the new benchmark assessment

* Updated commercial fleet diversity (fleet count and fleet diversity) have no long term trends, thus improving from moderate-high risk to low risk according to risk criteria for this element

### Increased Risk
* No indicators for individual elements have changed enough to warrant increased risk rankings according to the Council risk critiera (but see caveats regarding analyses that were not updated)

---

## Mid-Atlantic Council Ecosystem Approach

* Based on risk assessment, the Council selected summer flounder as high-risk fishery for conceptual modeling

```{r framework2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/Framework.png")
```

* Working group of habitat, biology, stock assessment, management, economic and social scientists are now developing:

  * draft conceptual models of high risk elements, linkages
  * dataset identification and gap analysis for each element and link
  * draft questions that the Council could persue with additional work

---
## Mid-Atlantic Council Ecosystem Approach

* The late 2018 summer flounder conceptual model, now under construction:

```{r sfconceptmod, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/Summerfl_EAFM_v2.png")
```

* Final conceptual modeling to be done by late 2019

* Council may then elect to proceed with management strategy evaluation (MSE) using the information from conceptual modeling as a basis

---
## IEA footnote: Improvements to reproducibility and provenance

* Reporting the information is not enough

* Managers appreciate the concise format, but back-end critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing
  
![soe-data-flow](EDAB_images/soe-data-flow.png)  

???
This workflows also ensures that there's no information lost between SOE cycles. We know exactly how a data set was analyzed and handled so that the data can be updated for next year's reports.

## SOE 2019 Overview Results

```{r nes-comp1, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/nes-components.png")
```

???
The purpose of this report is to synthesize available information relevant to fishery management in the Mid-Atlantic portion of the US Northeast Shelf. This 2019 report highlights where management interventions have proven successful to achieve ecological objectives, but also characterizes the considerable challenges for management posed by climate change and increasing trade-offs across conservation, fishing, and other human activities in this region. Finally, we describe combinations of ecological signals that present opportunities for further integrated research and possibly creative management solutions.

Plot shows the ratio of stock mortality (F) to stock mortality at maximum sustainable yield, where a number larger than one indicates the stock is experiencing unsustainable fishing pressure. On the x axis we have the ratio of estimated stock biomass to biomass at maximum sustainable yield.

Similar to NE, there's been a slight increase in recreational catch since the 90s in the Mid-Atlantic, along with a general increase in effort.

However, different from NE, there are significant downward trends in fleet effort diversity and diversity of catch. While a decline in fleet effort diversity is due to fewer party boats, we can't be sure why there's been a decline in diversity of catch, as South Atlantic FMC species are not tracked seperately.

The North Atlantic right whale is among the most endangered whales in the world, with less than 450 individuals remaining and declining abundance trends. Evidence suggests that interactions with fisheries are contributing to the decline of the fisheries. Between 2017 and 2018, there were 20 known right whale mortality events, and more than half of these were the direct result of entanglement or vessel strike. Right whale distributions may also be changing with climate related distribution shifts of their main food source, Calanus finmarchicus.

Traditional fisheries management is based around stable species distributions, but those distributions aren't static, and especially not in the context of changing ecosystem conditions

The NEFSC has run a bottom trawl survey since the early 1960s, and these figures highlight how distributions of managed species within feeding guilds have changed. 

The decline in NEFMC species in the mid survey is driven mostly by ocean pout, which has seen proportional declines in the gulf of maine and georges bank survey

For the Mid, we show offshore bottom trawl survey data paired with inshore bottom trawl data collected in the region by Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program.

There appear to be opposing trends in spring piscivore biomass between the two surveys, which could reflect higher prevalence of spiny dogfish offshore

We didn't include the data in this presentation, but we also recieved inshore survey data from the Maine/New Hampshire survey and Mass state survey, and we hope to take a deeper look over the next SOE cycle

Over the past few years, we've seen a strong departure of the gulf stream north wall from it's mean latitude

With that comes a larger percentage of warm slope water entering into gulf of maine through the NE channel
