## An integrated ecosystem assessment success story (in progress)

Diverse stakeholders agreed that an ecosystem approach was necessary. Developing and implementing an ecosystem approach to fishery management was done in collaboration between managers, stakeholders, and scientists. 
.pull-left[
*Outline*
- Why did managers decide to invest in an ecosystem approach?

- How did they develop their approach?

- Why risk assessment first?

- How did they develop the risk assessment?

- How are they using the risk assessment? What's next?

## Fishery management in the US

Eight regional Fishery Management Councils establish plans for sustainable management of stocks within their jurisdictions. All are governed by the same law, but tailor management to their regional stakeholder needs.

## Why an ecosystem approach?

*"We rebuilt all the stocks, so why is everyone still pissed off?" --Rich Seagraves*

in 2011, the Council asked:

.pull-left[
![visioning1](EDAB_images/MA_Visioning1.png)
]
.pull-right[
![visioning2](EDAB_images/MA_Visioning2.png)
]

And many people answered, from commercial fishery, recreational fishery, environmental organization, and interested public perspectives.

Visioning report: 

http://www.mafmc.org/s/MAFMC-stakeholder-input-report-p7b9.pdf

---
## Common themes among all stakeholder groups:

>• There is a lack of confidence in the data that drive fishery management decisions.
>
>• Stakeholders are not as involved in the Council process as they can and should be.
>
>• Different jurisdictions and regulations among the many fishery management organizations result in complexity and inconsistency.
>
>• There is a need for increased transparency and communications in fisheries management.
>
>• The dynamics of the ecosystem and food web should be considered to a greater extent in fisheries management decisions.
>
>• Stakeholders are not adequately represented on the Council.
>
>• Pollution is negatively affecting the health of fish stocks.

## <center>But where will the indicators come from?</center>

---

## Meanwhile, scientists were improving ecosystem reports:

*"So what?" --John Boreman, September 2016*

1. Clear linkage of ecosystem indicators with management objectives

1. Synthesis across indicators for big picture

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Short (< 30 pages), non-technical (but rigorous) text

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 

```{r nes-comp2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}

In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model

## Standardized indicator visualization in reports

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators** and plotted in a standardized way

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context<sup>1-3</sup>

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

## Risk assessent indicators and ranking criteria: System productivity

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and ranks the risk of not achieving optimum yield due to changes in ecosystem productivity at the base of the food web.

Four indicators are used together to assess risk of changing ecosystem productivity: primary production, zooplankton abundance, fish condition and fish recruitment. 

.table[
```{r riskecop, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "
| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trends in ecosystem productivity |
| Low-Moderate | Trend in ecosystem productivity (1-2 measures, increase or decrease) |
| Moderate-High | Trend in ecosystem productivity (3+ measures, increase or decrease) |
| High | Decreasing trend in ecosystem productivity, all measures |
"
cat(tabl) # output the table in a format good for HTML/PDF/docx conversion
```
]
???
We examine trends in total primary production, zooplankton abundance for a key Mid-Atlantic species, and two aggregate fish productivity measures: condition factor (weight divided by length of individual fish) and a survey based "recruitment" (small fish to large fish) index.

## Risk assessent indicators and ranking criteria: Climate 

This element is applied at the species level. Risks to species productivity (and therefore to achieving optimum yield) due to projected climate change in the Northeast US were evaluated in a comprehensive assessment<sup>1</sup>.

## EAFM risk assessment update 2019

The Mid-Atlantic Council requested that the State of the Ecosystem report indicators be used to annually update their EAFM risk assessment. 

*Therefore, ecosystem reporting now has a direct strategic use.*

### Decreased risk
* Summer flounder fishing mortality (F) status has improved from high risk (F>Fmsy) to low risk (F<Fmsy) based on the new benchmark assessment

* Updated commercial fleet diversity (fleet count and fleet diversity) have no long term trends, thus improving from moderate-high risk to low risk according to risk criteria for this element

### Increased risk
* No indicators for individual elements have changed enough to warrant increased risk rankings according to the Council risk critiera

## Mid-Atlantic council next steps

* Based on risk assessment, the Council selected summer flounder as high-risk fishery for conceptual modeling

```{r framework2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/Framework.png")
```

* Working group of habitat, biology, stock assessment, management, economic and social scientists are now developing:

  * draft conceptual models of high risk elements, linkages
  * dataset identification and gap analysis for each element and link
  * draft questions that the Council could persue with additional work

---
## Mid-Atlantic Council ecosystem approach continued...

* The late 2018 summer flounder conceptual model, now under construction:

```{r sfconceptmod, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("EDAB_images/Summerfl_EAFM_v2.png")
```

* Final conceptual modeling to be done by late 2019

* Council may then elect to proceed with management strategy evaluation (MSE) using the information from conceptual modeling as a basis

---
## Footnote: Improvements to reproducibility and provenance

* Reporting the information is not enough
* Managers appreciate the concise format, but back-end critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing
* Streamlined workflow allowed scientists to meet management deadlines
  
![soe-data-flow](EDAB_images/soe-data-flow.png)  

???
This workflows also ensures that there's no information lost between SOE cycles. We know exactly how a data set was analyzed and handled so that the data can be updated for next year's reports.

## Conclusions

Risk assessment is valuable for the general implementation of ecosystem approaches to natural resource management

* Risk assessment is a rapid, familiar, scaleable, and transparent method to move forward with EAFM within a real-world operational fishery management context 

* Risk assessment can be conducted collaboratively within existing stakeholder processes

* This EAFM risk assessment highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting Council-derived management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors 

* The Council foresees refining the process so that ecosystem indicators monitor risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives, which can then be mitigated through management action.
