## Summary

* The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC) has adapted IEA for their Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) decision framework

* Since the 2022 WGNARS meeting, MAFMC has

    +  Completed a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) within the EAFM framework
    +  Used models from the MSE in ongoing decision processes
    +  Initiated review and update of the EAFM risk assessment
    
* Since the 2022 WGNARS meeting, the MAFMC EAFM implementation has been used as an example

    +  At the United Nations 
    +  At the US National SSC meeting
    +  For US and EC fishery manager training
    +  For the US Caribbean FMC EBFM team
    +  At ICES WGEAWESS 
    +  At ECCWO5
    +  At the Recreational Fisheries Economics Workshop
    +  For the Ocean Studies Board

## Integrated Ecosystem Assessment and the MAFMC Ecosystem Approach

Diverse stakeholders agreed that an ecosystem approach was necessary. Developing and implementing EAFM is done in collaboration between managers, stakeholders, and scientists. https://www.mafmc.org/eafm

   * Direct link between ecosystem reporting and risk assessment
   * Conceptual model links across risk elements for fisheries, species
   * Management strategy evaluation includes key risks

]
???
The Councilâ€™s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.
