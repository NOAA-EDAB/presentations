1. Develop clearly specified questions and objectives 
  - What does the model have to output/predict?
  - What does the user need to be able to change?
  
1. Evaluate data availability (appropriate temporal/spatial scales) 
  
1. THEN build a model, or better, model(s)

# Today's objective

.pull-left-70[

Primary: Think about *your* research question  
  - What data do you have to address it?  
  - Would a model be useful to address your research question?  
  - If so, what would you want it to do?   
  - Advanced: How might you build it?  

Secondary: Understand what a food web model is  
  - Know what questions to ask about how it was built  
  - Know what it can and cannot do 
  - Experiment: perturb the model in different ways  
    - What do you observe?  
    - Why might this be? (including model limitations)

## What is a food web model?

.pull-left-60[
A system of linear equations

For each group, $i$, specify: 

   Biomass $B$ [or Ecotrophic Efficiency $EE$ ]  
   Population growth rate $\frac{P}{B}$  
   Consumption rate $\frac{Q}{B}$  
   Diet composition $DC$  
   Fishery catch $C$  
   Biomass accumulation $BA$  
   Im/emigration $IM$ and $EM$  
   
Solving for $EE$ [or $B$ ] for each group:

Mathematically identical to an "input-output" model in economics

## How do you build one?

Specify most parameters for each species; can solve for one

.pull-left[
How? Observations from:

1. Fishery independent surveys
  - Biomass estimates
  - Diet compositions
  - Growth and reproduction information
  
1. Catch/landings/discard data from fishery managers

1. Literature, historical information, general life history theory

1. Other transparent, reproducible processes/sources

## Possible exercises: work in teams

.pull-left[
[Anchovy Bay](https://gavinfay.shinyapps.io/rpath_anchovybay/):

1. Describe impacts of different fishing scenarios

1. Describe potential catch and biomass objectives

1. Can you engineer any scenarios to achieve them?

.pull-right[
[Gulf of Maine](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/content/6c128564-f8b2-49c4-8afc-614f9e2e7a5b/):

1. Describe impacts of different fishing scenarios

1. Describe impacts of individual species mortality scenarios

1. Describe the impacts of "as prey" scenario

1. Can you suggest mechanisms for any observed differences?

]

## Both models 

1. Describe your Ecosystem Based management objective

    + Can you achieve it by changing sliders?
    + Are there any side effects (tradeoffs) of achieving your objective?

Tradeoffs between forage groups and mixed impacts to predators apparent when multiple species and full predator prey interaction feedbacks can be included

* Rpath `r Cite(myBib,"lucey_conducting_2020")` Ecosense functions evaluate parameter uncertainty within a scenario

* Now we have MSE closed loop possibilities in Rpath `r Cite(myBib, "lucey_evaluating_2021")`

* Can implement HCRs with predator prey interactions

## Herring MSE food web model results: ecosystem uncertainty?

.pull-left-30[
Compare 10% change (green, same as previous slide gray boxes) with more extreme "herring" biomass:  
* 50% increase from base herring biomass (red)
* 50% decrease from base herring biomass (blue)

More system uncertainty with increased herring biomass?
