## Insights for fishery management

- Differences in food web structure between two adjacent ecosystems with similar biological communities and fishery management
  - Which species respond to the same perturbation
  - Level of uncertainty / predictability in response
  
- EBS: Influential group at mid trophic levels
  - Wasp waist transmits signal to other groups (neither AK system)
  - Self regulating dominant group (beer belly) absorbs signals
  - Beer belly systems are more predictable, stable as long as the beer belly maintains itself?

- GOA: Influential groups at high trophic levels
  - Magnifies bottom up signals and top down?
  - A less predictable system?
  - Subject to more radical change?

- Structure of a food web may determine how predictable a system is under perturbation, and how changes in primary production propagate through systems

<!--  $$\tilde{F}_y=\begin{cases}\psi F_{MSY}, & \text{if}\ \widehat{SSB}_y \geq SSB_{up} \\\psi F_{MSY} \frac{\widehat{SSB}_y - SSB_{low}}{SSB_{up}-SSB_{low}}, & \text{if}\ SSB_{low} < \widehat{SSB}_y < SSB_{up}\\0, & \text{if}\ \widehat{SSB}_y \leq SSB_{low}\end{cases}$$

Although there were no clear significant relationships of common tern productivity and the proportion of herring in diets across all colonies, there were some correlations between herring total biomass and tern productivity. 

Hence, the relationship on the right was developed to relate herring biomass to common tern productivity.

## What have we learned? Modeling allows us to test options
.pull-left-30[
Complex food web, generalist predators
- Herring is one of several important prey
- Assessing multiple prey together will likely show stronger effects on predator productivity
]
.pull-right-70[
![NEUSfw](EDAB_images/LinkNEUSfoodweb.png)
]
- Tern/Tuna/Groundfish/Mammal productivity is also affected by predators, weather, and other factors not modeled here
- Even relatively weak relationships still showed which herring control rules were poor
- Managers did select a harvest control rule considering a wide range of factors!

## Which models are best for management decisions? (Conclusions!)
.pull-left[
- Based on **clearly specified questions** (from managers/stakeholders)

- **Outputs** and **controls designed** to answer the questions

- Using **observations** directly from the ecosystem

- With clear description of **uncertainties**
