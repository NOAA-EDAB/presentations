## Project overview
.pull-left[
1. Scenarios for effects of temperature on growth, natural mortality

1. Focus on key stocks (Northeast Arctic cod, Norwegian spring spawning herring, California Current sardine, Pacific hake or a Pacific rockfish)

1. Atlantis output &rarr; dataset generator (`atlantisom`) &rarr; Stock Synthesis assessment 

1. Compare performance of different model settings, multiple models, model ensembles

## Stock assessment uncertainty

* Focus on climate impacts to growth and natural mortality (productivity)
* Full factorial design over common stock assessment assumptions

    * Growth:
      1. constant growth parameters
      1. regime shifts in growth parameters ([Stawitz et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783619300049?via%3Dihub))
      1. empirical weight-at-age ([Kuriyama et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783615300837))
      
    * Natural mortality:
      1. fixed at an “uninformed” constant value of 0.2
      1. fixed at a constant value that reflects the true average value (over time) from the OM
      1. establishing regimes by fixing at the true average values from the OM over specified time blocks
      
    * Also, an equally weighted ensemble of the 9 estimation models
    
* Stock synthesis framework initially, but extend to other assessment models, generalize, and use components of the REDUS framework

## Make atlantis output into assessment model input

Example workflow: 

1. Get true biomass, abundance, age composition, length composition, weight at age, fishery catch, fishery catch at age, fishery length composition, and fishery weight age age for a "sardine-like species": https://sgaichas.github.io/poseidon-dev/FullSardineTruthEx.html

1. Format these outputs and get other life history parameters for input into a stock assessment model ([Stock Synthesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783612003293), using [`r4ss`](https://github.com/r4ss)):
https://sgaichas.github.io/poseidon-dev/CreateStockSynthesis.html

1. Run the assessment model

## Full disclosure!

.pull-left[
Still working on:

1. Estimating total mortality to back out M

1. Splitting aggregate age groups into true ages (not needed for NOBA)

1. Interpolating aggregate age groups weight at age for true ages

1. Fishery catch weight by area

1. Generalizing for different Atlantis codebase vintages

## Specify uncertainty in assessment "data": REDUS to the rescue!

What level of uncertainty is appropriate to carry through these analyses?
.pull-left[
1. Biological:

    1. appropriate sigma-R?

1. Survey specification:

    1. timing and spatial coverage?

    1. which species are captured?

    1. species-specific survey efficiency ("q")?

    1. selectivity at age for each species?

] 
.pull-right[
1. Survey uncertainty:

    1. additional observation error (survey cv for index)?
    
    1. effective sample size for biological samples?
    
1. Fishery uncertainty:
    
    1. additional observation error (catch cv for total)?
    
    1. catch sampled for length/age in all areas?
    
    1. effective sample size for biological samples?
