## Background: catch at length/age

.pull-left[

* Determine how landings data are aggregated based on available length samples

* How are missing length samples handled

* Need to recognize species specific rules for calculating catch at length & age
  * life history traits
  * where in time to borrow length samples
  * length-weight relationships
  * Is species aged?

* Need to know data sources

* Initial meeting with Kiersten, Gary, Paul to formulate a set of rules/decision [tree](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDhGCKK1HjQ32ymDh9ayZCt6MsHydtu3GHnetGJetUE/edit)

## Stock Efficiency 

.pull-left[

* StockEff already does some of this, why reinvent the wheel?
  * Excel template for species to be added to commercial module
  * Creates a record of how data was made

### Why not just use these templates?

* Interest centers on the decision making process prior to entering information into this template

* Multispecies models require data for many species on a different spatial footprint from assessments

## mscatch as an R package

.pull-left[
* Address the decision making process

* Define species specific rules.

* Reproducible with documentation of decisions (Transparency)

* Multispecies length and age based models require data on a different spatial footprint from assessments
  *   Many challenges
  *   Alternate spatial footprints could result in the absence of species data (eg. Mackerel, herring on Georges Bank) 
  *   Encompass multiple species stocks (eg. Winter flounder on Georges Bank)

* Evaluate the performance of multispecies assessment models

## Walkthrough

.pull-left[

* Currently borrows length samples: 
      * from previous QTR/SEMESTER
      * use nearest neighbor in time
      * use nearest neighbor from another gear type
* uses survey length-weight data to fit relationship
  
* Process for handling missing length samples will be expanded to incorporate today's discussion.

## Species specific considerations: Rules

* How are gear types aggregated?

* How are market codes aggregated?

* How are landing aggregated temporally? QTR, SEMESTER, ANNUAL?

* What are the rules implemented when length samples are missing?
  * What are the minimum number of samples required?
  * 200 mt landings for every 100 fish lengths measured?
  * borrow samples from nearest neighbor? previous year? within last 5 years?
  * combine temporally?
  * combine gears?

class: ws

## Species specific considerations: Data

* Sources for length-weight data/parameters?
  * From survey and/or commercial?
  * Fit own relationship or use parameters pulled from svdbs database (Wigley et al)
  * How many length-weight relationships are used? QTR, SEMESTER, sex, gear type?

* Sources for discard data?
  * Are length samples available?
  * Add to totals prior to length expansion?

* Sources for age data?
  * From survey and/or commercial?
  * Age-length same level of aggregation or futher aggregate?
  
* Sources for foreign data? 

* What is the first year of data used in assessment?

* Stock area definition? Statistical areas?
