## Background: catch at length

.pull-left[

* Determine how landings data are aggregated based on available length samples

* How is missing length samples are handled

* Need to recognize species specific rules for calculating catch at length & age
  * life history traits
  * where in time to borrow length samples
  * length-weight relationships
  * Is species aged?

* Need to know data sources

* Initial meeting with Kiersten, Gary, Paul to formulate a set of rules/decision [tree](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDhGCKK1HjQ32ymDh9ayZCt6MsHydtu3GHnetGJetUE/edit)

]

```{r,out.width = "450px"}

## Stock Efficiency 

.pull-left[

* StockEff already does some of this, why reinvent the wheel?
  * Excel template for species to be added to commercial module
  * Creates a record of how data was made
  * Manual data entry

### Why not just use these templates?

* The decision making process prior to entering information into this template is not available and hard to reproduce

* Multispecies models require data for many species on a different spatial footprint from assessments

## mscatch as an R package

.pull-left[
* Address the decision making process

* Define species specific rules.

* Reproduce results and fully documented process (Transparent)

* Length and age based multispecies models.

* Evaluate the performance of multispecies assessment models

* Multispecies models require data on a different spatial footprint from assessments
  *   Many challenges
  *   Alternate spatial footprints could result in the absence of species data (eg. Mackerel, herring on Georges Bank) 
  *   Encompass multiple species stocks (eg. Winter flounder on Georges Bank)

## Species specific condsiderations: Rules

* How are gear types aggregated?

* How are market codes aggregated?

* How are landing aggregated temporally? QTR, SEMESTER, ANNUAL?

* What are the rules implemented when length samples are missing?
  * What is the minumum number of samples required?
  * borrow samples from nearest neighbor? (previous year? within last 5 years?)
  * combine temporally?
  * combine gears?

## Species specific condsiderations: Data

* Sources of length-weight data/parameters?
  * From survey and/or commercial?
  * Fit own relationship or use parameters pulled from svdbs database (Wigley et al)
  * How many length-weight relationships are used? QTR, SEMESTER, sex, geartype?

* Sources of discard data?
  * Are length samples available?
  * Add to totals prior to lengh expansion?

* Sources of age data?
  * From survey and/or commercial?
  * Age-length same level of aggregation or futher aggregate?

* What is the first year of data used in assessment?

* Stock area definition: Stat areas used to pull data

class: mackerel

## A case study: Mackerel

* All gears combined into a single gear type

* Aggregate to semesters (Jan-Jun, Jul-Dec)

* Market codes: SQ, ES, SV combined to SMALL

* Market codes: XG, JB, LG combined into LARGE

* Borrow sample from previous semester within the same market category
  * 5 year average over both semesters
  * market category time series average

* 6 Length-weight relationships (3 time intervals per semester)
  *   Fitted to bottom trawl data (after QA/QC for anomalous values)

* Age-length data from Bottom trawl survey and Commercial data. Combine

* Age-length key: By Year
  
* Start date: 1992 

---

class: yf

## A case study: Yellowtail

* All gears combined into a single gear type

* Aggregate to semesters (Jan-Jun, Jul-Dec)

* Market codes: SQ, MD, PW combined to SMALL, LG

* No Borrowing of samples.
  * Combine Semesters
  * Bump catch at age totals
  
* Length-weight relationships (Half year)
  * Fitted to bottom trawl data 

* Age-length data (pooled sexes)
  * US landings from Commercial data.
  * Canadian landings from survey and commercial

* Age-length key: By Half Year
  
* Start date: 1973

class: herring

## A case study: Herring

* Landings from state of Maine

* Gears: Mobile (Trawl, Seines: 170,120,121,122,124,370 + ?), Fixed (all other gear types)

* Aggregate to quarter year

* Market codes: All unclassified

* No Borrowing of samples.
  * Combine quarters to semesters for gear type
  * Combine quarters to Year for gear type

* Length-weight relationships (same as aggregation)
  * Fitted to commercial length samples 

* Age-length data
  * Separate database.
  
* Age-length key: Year, Semester, gear type

* Start date: 1965

## Walkthrough

.pull-left[
  * Process for filling in holes needs expanding to incorporate today's discussion.
  * Currently only borrows length samples: 
    * from previous QTR/SEMESTER
    * use nearest neighbor in time
    * use nearest neighbor from another gear type
    
  * uses survey length-weight data to fit relationship

## Questions

* What are we missing?

* What diagnostics are useful?

* Helpful to post species specific diagnostics and length and age compositions for feedback
