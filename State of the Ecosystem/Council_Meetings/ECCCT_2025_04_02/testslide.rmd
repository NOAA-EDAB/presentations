## New England State of the Ecosystem Summary 2025: 

.pull-left-60[
TOR:C2 performance metrics

- Status and trend are descriptive but don't provide a "desired state or trend"
- For instance commercial revenue is near the long-term average. Is that good? Is there another metric we want to assess how well that objective is being met?
- Example objective for commercial revenue: "Revenue stays above 1990 levels for 5 years and has a neutral or positive trend"
- Need to work on reference points among indicators with NEFMC
