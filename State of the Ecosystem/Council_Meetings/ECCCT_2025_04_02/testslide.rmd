## Risks: Offshore Wind Development Summary

.pull-left[

```{r,  fig.height=4}

Implications:
*  Current plans for buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region 
*  Planned wind areas overlap with one of the only known right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.

???
*  1-23% (Mid-Atlantic) or 1-34% (New England) of port revenue from fisheries currently comes from areas proposed for offshore wind development. Some communities have environmental justice concerns and gentrification vulnerability.
*  Up to 20% of annual commercial landings and revenue for Mid-Atlantic species occur in lease areas.
*  Up to 53% of annual commercial landings and 54% of revenue for New England species occur in lease areas.

Evaluating the impacts to scientific surveys has begun.
