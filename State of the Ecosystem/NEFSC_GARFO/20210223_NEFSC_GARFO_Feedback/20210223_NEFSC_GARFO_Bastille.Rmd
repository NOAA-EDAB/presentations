## State of the Ecosystem (SOE) Reporting: Context for busy people

*"So what?" --John Boreman, September 2016*

1. Clear linkage of ecosystem indicators with management objectives

1. Synthesis across indicators for big picture

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Short (< 30 pages), non-technical (but rigorous) text

1. Emphasis on reproducibility


???
In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model
Many indicators presented at WGNARS, used in larger Ecosystem Status reports
Shorter, fishery specific State of the Ecosystem (SOE) report with conceptual models prototyped based on California Current reporting
Feedback from fishery managers redesigned reporting to align with objectives outlined by WGNARS

## Ecosystem synthesis themes for 2021

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management 

* **Multiple drivers** - Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors that influence the marine ecosystems. 
* **Regime shifts** - large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem
* **Ecosystem Reorganization** - e.g. Tropicalization

* Offshore wind areas may cover more than 1.7 million acres by 2030.

* If all sites are developed, 2-24% of total average revenue could be displaced for major Mid-Atlantic species in lease areas.


* Displaced fishing effort can alter fishing methods, which can in turn change habitat, species (managed and protected), and fleet interactions.


* Right whales may be displaced, and altered local oceanography could affect distribution of their zooplankton prey.

## How to get involved

### Questions to ask:

* Is my data relevant to a management objective?

* How could my data/work be used to support a story relevant to the fisheries managers?

* Is this data already being included in the report or is it missing?

* Is my data private? Can an aggregated version be made available to the public? 

### Next Steps: 

* Fill out the linked form.
