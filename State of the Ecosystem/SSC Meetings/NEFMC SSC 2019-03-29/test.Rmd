## Changing base of the food web: primary production

* Summer PP is increasing in the Mid-Atlantic (and in New England)
  * Driven by warmer temperatures and increased bacterial remineralization and nutrient recycling
  * Increasing primary production likely due to higher productivity of smaller phytoplankton

```{r pp-trends, fig.width=10, fig.height = 5}
out_pp <- ecodata::chl_pp %>%
  filter(EPU %in% c("GOM","GB"),
         str_detect(Var, "MONTHLY_PPD_MEDIAN")) %>%
  separate(.,Time, into = c("Year","Month"), sep = 4) %>%
    mutate(Month = plyr::mapvalues(Month, from = c("01","02","03","04","05","06",
                                                   "07","08","09","10","11","12"),
                                   to = c(month.abb))) %>%
  group_by(EPU, Month) %>%
  mutate(hline = mean(Value))
out_pp$Month <- factor(out_pp$Month, levels = month.abb)


 pp_cci_gb <-out_pp %>%
  filter(EPU == "GB") %>%
 ggplot() +
   # geom_gls(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Month))+
    geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Month)) +
    geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = Month)) +
    scale_x_discrete(name = "Time", breaks = seq(min(out_pp$Year),max(out_pp$Year),10)) +
    facet_wrap(Month~., ncol = 6) +
    ggtitle("GB Monthly median PPD") +
    ylab(expression("PP (gC m"^-2*" d"^-1*")")) +
        geom_hline(aes(yintercept = hline,
                     group = Month),
           size = hline.size,
           alpha = hline.alpha,
           linetype = hline.lty)+
    theme_facet() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1),
          panel.spacing = unit(1, "lines"),
          plot.margin = unit(c(0.1, 0, 0, 0), "cm"))

## Changing base of the food web: Zooplankton size structure

* Lower copepod size index means higher abundance of large copepods (<i>Calanus</i>)
* Primary production may play a role in zooplankton size dynamics on the shelf


```{r NE-sli, fig.height = 5, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 8}
source("R/sli_plots.R")
gom_out <- sli_plots("GOM")
gb_out <- sli_plots("GB")

gom_out[[1]] +  gb_out[[1]] +gom_out[[2]] + gb_out[[2]] + plot_layout(ncol=2)
```

???
To assess the size structure of copepods in the region, we use the small-large index.
* A measure of relative size composition of the dominant copepod taxa
* A lower value means higher abundance of large copepods (<i>Calanus</i>)
* Primary production may play a role in copepod size dynamics***

## Changing base of the food web and fish conditions

* Fish condition is measured at the weight at a given length relative to the average
  * Drop-off in condition around 2000 aligns with the shift in zooplankton size-structure on the shelf

*NEFMC Condition Factor*
```{r fish-con2, fig.align="center",out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("20190329_NEFMC_SSC_Hardison_images/NEFMC_Fish_Condition_2019.jpg")
```


???
Looking at condition in aggregate across all managed stocks, we can see a clear decline in condition between 2000-2010

Recent improvement within past decade

Interestingly, the drop-off in condition around 2000 resembles a shift in zooplankton size-structure on the shelf, and this is a topic for future research

## SOE 2019: Improvements to reproducibility and provenance

* Reporting the information is not enough

* Managers appreciate the concise format, but back-end critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing
  
![soe-data-flow](20190329_NEFMC_SSC_Hardison_images/soe-data-flow.png)  

???
This workflows also ensures that there's no information lost between SOE cycles. We know exactly how a data set was analyzed and handled so that the data can be updated for next year's reports.
