* The SOE falls under ESRs and is an intergral part to the IEA loop. 
* The SOE is specifically written with fishery managerers as the audience
* It's current uses include direct links to mgmt objectives, uses an open science emphasis, and is used by the MAFMC for risk assessment, conceptual modeling, and MSE

## Ecosystem synthesis themes: still framing! but replace p.4 with 2023 Highlights

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

* Provide an orientation for reading and interpreting the report
* The northeast is split up into 3 EPUs. The New England report covers GB and GOM
* Report is structured like an information funnel: high level = report, detailed interpretation or context = catalog, detailed methods = technical documentation
  + The data catalog has been reworked to now be like an encyclopedia entry for each indicator and should be first stop if you want to learn more. 
  + Living document that will be updated with each annual report
* Indicator time series are presented in standard format
  + shaded region = last 10 years
  + colored line shows trend (if present)
  + Trends not evaluated if < 30 data, but working on new methods for shorter time series

* These two sections performance and risks to mgmt objectives have similar components to last year but have been restructured
* For performance we focus on *what* indicators say and *why* we think it's changing
* For risks we focus start with the indicator of risk, explain its drivers, and discuss future considerations
  + These are split into risks for spatial, seasonal, and quota setting/rebuilding
  + Conclude with offshore wind development

* Tracking memo describes the requests we've received from both councils, it's current status, and a ranking done by the MAFMC
* Many high priority tasks were delayed due to staff turnover with the major changes relating to the report organization and the online catalog
* Currently in progress includes: developing EOF indicators, development of short term ecosystem forecasts with CEFI, methodology for assessing regime shifts,and stock-level indicators through ESPs and thresholds analyses.

* The summary report cards show the objectives (with associated indicator), whether the 30 year trend is +/-, whether the current statis is above or below a long-term mean, and a brief description of potential implications
*There is a separate card for GB and GOM but some of the indicators are identical
*Some indicators are a current-year snapshot and we don't indentify trend, only status

* These plots provide a snapshot of the presence of environmental justice issues in the most highly engaged and most highly reliant commercial and recreational fishing communities in New England.
  + Engagement is a measure of fishing activity where Reliance is fishing activity relative to population size
  + For example, New Bedford has the highest engagement due to the volume of fishing activity in the community, but since activity is relatively small given the population of the community, it has a low reliance score
  + Communities are color-coded based on their Environmental Justice Vulnerability index
  + Communities that are high in both engagement and reliance are vulnerabile to changes in fishing patterns. These include Stonington and Beals, ME
*Communities EJ vulnerability is scores as a composite of several census indices relating to personal disruption, population composition, and poverty
  + New Bedford and Boston had previously been identified as having higher EJ vulnerability, with the inclusion of Swans Island, ME this year. Swans Island has a high unemployment concerns but without the demographic concerns seen in the other two larger cities.
  + Communities that experience EJ issues might have a lower capacity to respond to changing environments or regulations

* Signs the adult population stabilized 2020-2022

* Population drivers for North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW) include combined fishery interactions/ship strikes, distribution shifts, and copepod availability. 

* Additional potential stressors include offshore wind development, which overlaps with important habitat areas used year-round by right whales, including mother and calf migration corridors and foraging habitat.

* Unusual mortality events continue for 3 large whale species. 1 UME is pending closure for pinnipeds.

## Risks to Spatial Management: Future Considerations

*   Distribution shifts caused by changes in thermal habitat are likely to continue as long as long-term temperature trends persist. 
*   Near-term oceanographic forecasts are currently in development and may inform how future warming impacts species distributions.
*   Increased oceanographic variability needs to be captured by regional ocean models and linked to species distribution processes to better understand potential future distributions. Species with high mobility or short lifespans react differently from immobile or long lived species.

Adapting management to changing stock distributions and dynamic ocean processes will require continued monitoring of populations in space and evaluating management measures against a range of possible future spatial distributions. 

*   [East Coast Climate Scenario Planning](https://www.mafmc.org/climate-change-scenario-planning) can help coordinate management.
*   [Near term predictions of distribution shifts](https://www.lenfestocean.org/nb/news-and-publications/multimedia/crafting-models-to-predict-near-term-fisheries-shifts-under-climate-change) project in progress

???
* The distribution shifts that we've observed are caused by persistent global and regional effects of climate change 
  + We don't expect distributions to shift back as long as long-term warming trends persist
* As part of NOAA's CEFI, near-term oceanographic forecasts are in development that will help identify how warming may impact species distributions
  + There is a real need to understand how species distributions relate to oceanographic variability and how species' life history relates to range shifts
* Changing stocks will require managers to monitor and consider possible future distributions in mgmt actions
  + The East Coast Climate Change Scenario Planning group is looking to build pathways to better coordinate mgmt and research

* Unlike the long-term trends driving distribution shits, shifts in phenology are driven by changes in the timing of seasonal environmental processes
  + There has been a long-term increase in the length of the summer, driven by a later fall turnover in both regions

## Risks to Quota Setting/Rebuilding: Future Considerations

*   There is a real risk that short-term predictions in assessments and rebuilding plans that assume unchanging underlying conditions will not be as effective, given the observed change documented in the prior sections in both ecological and environmental processes. 
*   Assumptions for speciesâ€™ growth, reproduction, and natural mortality should continue to be evaluated for individual species. 
*   With observations of system-wide productivity shifts of multiple managed stocks, more research is needed to determine whether regime shifts or ecosystem reorganization are occurring, and how this should be incorporated into management.

???
* Given the long-term environmental change and species shifts described in the other sections, there's a real risk of ineffective rebuilding plans or short-term predictions if not accounted for

* Offshore wind development has begun in NE and poses several risks to fishing and fisheries mgmt
* We estimate the historical fishery revenue that was harvested from wind lease areas from 2008 to 2022
  + Depending on the species this represents 3-54% of the maximum annual revenue (windowpane - redfish)
  + By raw revenue: scallop, monkfish, herring, skates, and silver hake make up the largest impacted revenue
  + Most the scallop overlap with wind lease areas occurs in the MAB
  + The overlap will likely decrease in the GOM when BOEM finalizes the lease areas
* We also calculate the port revenue obtained from wind lease areas
  + The dark blue is the min WEA revenue, and the med blue is the max
  + Some of the highest minimum impact ports include Boston, Little COmpton, and Westport
  + These are port-wide metrics, and the effects of individual operators can still be quite high despite a lower percent revenue
  + Ports are also marked if they have higher EJ or gentrification concerns
* We've also fulfilled a council request to see these statistics for the mid-Atlantic ports that rely on New England managed species

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development: Implications

.pull-left[

```{r,  fig.height=2}
#code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-wind-proposed-dev.R"),

ecodata::plot_wind_dev_speed()
```


Implications:
*  Current plans for buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region 
*  Planned wind areas overlap with one of the only known right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.

???
* Despite some changes in the timeline, offshore wind developement is still ramping up and 2030 goals are expected to be met
  + Delays in some projects may mean that the development timeline is faster in coming years
* The staggered development in space and time means that impacts will affect regions differently and at different times
* Beyond fishery revenue some of the other major impacts include:
  + Protected species interactions, particularly NARW calf migration corridors as whale hotspots overlap with lease areas. This is particularly concerning for southern NE, especially during construction
  + The effects on federal surveys through operations, survey design, habitat modification, and navigation. There's an ongoing effort to better quantify and mitigate these impacts.

## 2023 Highlights

* Hypoxia and OA off NJ

![:img NJ hypoxia](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/raw/dev/workshop/images/Figure2-GraceSaba_2024.png)

* Record *low* hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay since 1995, relatively cool summer with high salinity.

* Sea scallop recruitment detected Spring 2022, gone in Spring 2023

* Days in 2022 at or above scallop stress temperature 17-19 C &rarr;

* The final section is a more detailed look at 2023 highlights. These can either have positive, negative, or unknown implications, but were deemed notable by SOE contributors. 
  + If events become frequent or are worth monitoring for in the future, they may become new indicators
* Overall 2023 was an extremely warm year globally. The added El Nino conditions changed preciptication patterns around the region as well
* There were observed hypoxia and low pH events off of NJ that may have contribed to recorded die offs.
  + We are working on better representing oxygen and OA conditions over time
* In contrast, The Chesapeake Bay saw record *low* hypoxia, inmproving finfish and benthic habitat.
* A sea scallop mortality event was observed in Elephan Trunk off of NJ, which was believed to be related to localized warming events on the bottom
  + The plot shows the number of days in 2022 that temperature was within a scallop-specific thermal stress window based on GLORYS reanalysis
  + Elephant Trunk is highlighted in bold, with an average of 30 days in those conditions
  + This and other species-specific thermal tolerance metrics are in development now

## 2023 Highlights

* Gulf Stream inshore, fewer rings

```
Intermittent warm waters like this can be threats to temperature sensitive species, especially species at the southern end of their range or are not mobile (e.g. scallops), while also providing suitable habitat for more southern species.
]

???
* There were also large-scale changes in circulation
* The Gulf stream experienced large meanders coming up onto the shelf, bringing warm waters
  + Events like these can harm temperature sensitive species or provide new habitat for southern species
* There was also a decline in warm core rings, bucking a consistently  high level since 2000.

* The GOM experiened the largest phytoplankton bloom on record with Chlorophyll levels nearly 10 times average.
  + The bloom was caused by a resident dinoflagellate Tripos muelleri
  + Though large, this extra production was not grazed nor was it found in sediments
  + Ongoing work is in progress to assess the impact of this bloom and its causes
