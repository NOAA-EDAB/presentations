## Ecosystem synthesis themes: still framing! but replace p.3 with 2023 Highlights

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** — large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

.pull-left-60[
Climate: risks to spatial & seasonal management, quota setting and rebuilding
*  Fish and protected species distribution shifts
    - Forage fish shifts
    - Increased temperature, changing oceanography, smaller cold pool
*  Changes to spawn timing and migration
    - Fall bloom timing and food availability changing 
    - Longer summer conditions
*  Multiple fish stocks with poor condition, declining productivity 
    - Prey quality and abundance changing
    - Multiple stressors: temperature, OA, low oxygen

Other ocean uses: offshore wind development
*  Current revenue in proposed areas
    - 1-23% by port (some with EJ concerns)
    - up to 20% by managed species
*  Overlap with important right whale foraging habitats, increased vessel strike and noise risks

Few managed species have binding limits; Management less likely playing a role
]
]



???
Stock status affects catch limits established by the Council, which in turn may affect landings trends. Summed across all MAFMC managed species, total Acceptable Biological Catch or Annual Catch Limits (ABC or ACL) have been relatively stable 2012-2020 (top). With the addition of blueline tilefish management in 2017, an additional ABC and ACL contribute to the total 2017-2020. Discounting blueline tilefish, the recent total ABC or ACL is lower relative to 2012-2013, with much of that decrease due to declining Atlantic mackerel ABC. 

Nevertheless, the percentage caught for each stock’s ABC/ACL suggests that these catch limits are not generally constraining as most species are well below the 1/1 ratio (bottom). Therefore, stock status and associated management constraints are unlikely to be driving decreased landings for the majority of species.

]
]


???
Because stock status is mostly acceptable, ABCs don't appear to be constraining for many stocks, and aggregate biomass trends appear stable, the decline in commercial landings is most likely driven by market dynamics affecting the landings of surfclams and ocean quahogs, as quotas are not binding for these species.

Climate change also seems to be shifting the distribution of surfclams and ocean quahogs, resulting in areas with overlapping distributions and increased mixed landings. Given the regulations governing mixed landings, this could become problematic in the future and is currently being evaluated by the Council.

Implications

* Increased angler trips in 2020 relative to previous years strongly influenced the previously reported long term increase in recreational effort. Adding 2021 data, recreational effort (angler trips) has no long term trend.  
* The increasing long term trend from 2021 changed the risk categories for the RecValue element to low-moderate (previously ranked high risk). No trend indicates low risk.  
* Decline in recreational fleet diversity suggests a potentially reduced range of opportunities.  
* Driven by party/charter contraction and a shift toward shore based angling.

]

???
Changes in recreational fleet diversity can be considered when managers seek options to maintain recreational opportunities. Shore anglers will have access to different species than vessel-based anglers, and when the same species, typically smaller fish. Many states have developed shore-based regulations where the minimum size is lower than in other areas and sectors to maintain opportunities in the shore angling sector.

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development Summary

.pull-left[
Implications: *revise*
*  X% of port revenue from fisheries currently comes from areas proposed for offshore wind development. Some communities have environmental justice concerns and gentrification vulnerability.
*  Up to Y% of annual commercial landings and revenue for Mid-Atlantic species occur in lease areas.
*  Development will affect species differently, negatively affecting species that prefer soft bottom habitat while potentially benefiting species that prefer hard structured habitat.
*  Planned wind areas overlap with one of the only known right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.

Current plans for rapid buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region 
Evaluating the impacts to scientific surveys has begun.
