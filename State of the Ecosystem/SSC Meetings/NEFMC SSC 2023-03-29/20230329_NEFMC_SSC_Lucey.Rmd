## Ecosystem synthesis themes

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** — large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

Multiple potential drivers of landings changes: ecosystem and stock production, management actions, market conditions (including COVID-19 disruptions), and environmental change

???
Although scallop decreases are partially explained by a decreased TAC, analyses suggest that the drop in landings is at least partially due to market disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, we do not anticipate the long-term declining trend in landings to change.

Stocks below BMSY increased from 8 to 9, stocks below ½ BMSY decreased from 6 to 4. Spiny dogfish results from RT are unofficial.  Management still likely playing large role in seafood declines

Drivers:
* decline in commercial landings is most likely driven by the requirement to rebuild individual stocks as well as market dynamics
* other drivers affecting recreational landings: shark fishery management, possibly survey methodology

* climate risks including warming, ocean acidification, and shifting distributions  
* ecosystem composition and production changes

These plots provide a snapshot of the presence of environmental justice issues in the most highly engaged and most highly reliant commercial and recreational fishing communities in the Mid-Atlantic. These communities may be vulnerable to changes in fishing patterns due to regulations and/or climate change. When any of these communities are also experiencing social vulnerability including environmental justice issues, they may have lower ability to successfully respond to change.

## Risks: Ecosystem productivity

```{r , code=readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/macrofauna_MAB.Rmd-energy-density.R"), out.width = "90%", fig.asp = 0.5}

```

Implications: fluctuating environmental conditions and prey for forage species affect both abundance and energy content. Energy content varies by season, and has changed over time most dramatically for Atlantic herring

```

Implications: forage, including species not well sampled by bottom trawls, has been fluctuating over time. Richness calculated for the most common species suggests shifts away from the Mid Atlantic towards Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine.

Common tern productivity decline reflecting prey, confounded by cold, wet wether in mid-to-late July when fledging occurs

*Gray seals increasing*
* Breeding season ~ 27,000 US gray seals, Canada's population ~ 425,000 (2016) 
* Canada's population increasing at ~ 4% per year
* U.S. pupping sites increased from 1 (1988) to 9 (2019)
* Harbor and gray seals are generalist predators that consume more than 30 different prey species: red, white and silver hake, sand lance, yellowtail flounder, four-spotted flounder, Gulf-stream flounder, haddock, herring, redfish, and squids.

Implications: stable predator populations suggest stable predation pressure on managed species, but increasing predator populations may reflect increasing predation pressure.

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development Summary

.pull-left[
Implications:
*  1 - 31% of port revenue from fisheries currently comes from areas proposed for offshore wind development. Some communities have environmental justice concerns and gentrification vulnerability.
*  Up to 12% of annual commercial revenue for New England species occur in lease areas.
*  Development will affect species differently, negatively affecting species that prefer soft bottom habitat while potentially benefiting species that prefer hard structured habitat.
*  Planned wind areas overlap with important right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.

???
Current plans for rapid buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region 
Evaluating the impacts to scientific surveys has begun.

Now organized by priority and category

*  Priority from SSC eco WG and Council
*  Categories from SOE team
*  Highest priority requests in progress
    -  System level thresholds and reference points
    -  Trend analysis, inflections and break points
    -  Regime shifts
*  Identified some gaps
    - Short term forecasts
    - Management complexity
    - Recreational bycatch
*  Stock level indicators best addressed in research tracks?
*  SOE use statistics and memo updates in progress
*  Lowest priority requests likely to be dropped
