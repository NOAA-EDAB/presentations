# Two viable proxies for profits explored

- Net Revenue 
  + Federally permitted vessels  only

- Profitability Ratio
  +   Numerator = Total Gross Revenue
  +   Denominator = Average cost on federally permitted trips

# Cost coverage

<font size="5">
- Only available for federally permitted trips
  +   Different trend in gross revenue for Non-federally permitted trips
  +   Corresponds to differences in production/cost functions

# Net Revenue for Federally Permitted Trips

<font size="5">
- Trends follow Gross Revenue
<font>
 
```{r netrev, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/netrev-1.png")

# Profitability

<font size="5">
- Gross Revenue, Average Cost, Revenue/Cost ratio
<font>
 
```{r profitability, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Profitability-1.png")

# Cointegration Analysis

<font size="5">
- SSC request
- Do gross revenues move with diesel costs?
<font>
 
```{r unitroot, fig.show = "hold",as.is=TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Unitroot.png")

# Cointegration Analysis

<font size="5">
- Unit Root tests confirmed by regression of gross revenue on diesel price
<font>
 
```{r cointegration, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "47%",fig.align = "center"}

# Summing Up

- Net Revenue standard proxy for profits
  + Only covers 50 - 75% of Mid-Atlantic trip revenue
  
- Profitability indices possible
  + Tenuous assumption that federally permitted trip costs good representation for non-federally permitted costs
  
- No cointegration between gross revenue and diesel prices on non-federally permitted trips

???

# SSC recommendation?

Proposal 1. A combination of Gross Revenue from all trips in the Mid-Atlantic region and Net Revenue estimates for federally-permitted vessels.

Proposal 2. Revenue, Cost, and Profitability Indices
