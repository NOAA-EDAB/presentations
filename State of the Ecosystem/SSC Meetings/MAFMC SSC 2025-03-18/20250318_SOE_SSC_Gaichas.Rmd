## Ecosystem synthesis themes

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** — large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

*  BUT
*  Cooler conditions across the coast
*  Well established Mid Atlantic Cold Pool
*  Multiple summer upwelling events off NJ 
*  Extreme ocean acidification measured off NJ
*  Many fishery observations of new spatial and timing patterns, changed abundance 
*  Good scallop recruitment in Nantucket lightship
*  More red drum in Chesapeake Bay
*  Arctic copepods in GOM
*  Cocolithophore bloom off NY
*  Large whale aggregations

## Priority categories in the Request Memo

.pull-left-40[
The memo is organized into categories by topic, and categories are listed in descending order of overall (2022) priority based on approximate weighting within the category.

Therefore, a range of priority may be applied to individual requests within a category even though the entire category has an overall priority.

*The subgroup agreed to keep this group priority ranking*

*System level thresholds/reference points*
Includes requests to develop analytical methods that can be applied across all indicator types and operationalized for management advice. Much of this high priority methodological work is in progress.
*Management*
Includes analyses related to management performance. Work on this category is resource limited.
*Short term forecasts*
Includes requests for biological and environmental forecasts. These forecasts may be forthcoming from CEFI products once they are tested. 
*Regime shifts*
Many analyses have been conducted and are in progress for individual ecosystem components, but a unifying framework with consistent methods is needed for the SOE.
*Multiple system drivers*
This category has the most requests. Most unranked requests from 2023 are in this category. Prioritization within this category is sorely needed.
*Functional group level status/thresholds/reference points*
Most of these requests are in progress. 
*Stock level indicators*
Requests for this information may be more appropriately directed to stock specific ecosystem products such as Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs).

]

???
Stock status affects catch limits established by the Council, which in turn may affect landings trends. Summed across all MAFMC managed species, total Acceptable Biological Catch or Annual Catch Limits (ABC or ACL) have been relatively stable 2012-2020 (top). With the addition of blueline tilefish management in 2017, an additional ABC and ACL contribute to the total 2017-2020. Discounting blueline tilefish, the recent total ABC or ACL is lower relative to 2012-2013, with much of that decrease due to declining Atlantic mackerel ABC. 

Nevertheless, the percentage caught for each stock’s ABC/ACL suggests that these catch limits are not generally constraining as most species are well below the 1/1 ratio (bottom). Therefore, stock status and associated management constraints are unlikely to be driving decreased landings for the majority of species.

]
]


???
Because stock status is mostly acceptable, ABCs don't appear to be constraining for many stocks, and aggregate biomass trends appear stable, the decline in commercial landings is most likely driven by market dynamics affecting the landings of surfclams and ocean quahogs, as quotas are not binding for these species.

Climate change also seems to be shifting the distribution of surfclams and ocean quahogs, resulting in areas with overlapping distributions and increased mixed landings. Given the regulations governing mixed landings, this could become problematic in the future and is currently being evaluated by the Council.

Implications

* Adding 2023 data, recreational effort (angler trips) retains the long term increase.  

* The increasing long term trend changed the risk category for the RecValue element back to low-moderate (previously ranked low risk).

* *New risk element*: Decline in recreational fleet diversity suggests a potentially reduced range of opportunities. 

* Driven by party/charter contraction and a shift toward shore based angling.

]

???
Changes in recreational fleet diversity can be considered when managers seek options to maintain recreational opportunities. Shore anglers will have access to different species than vessel-based anglers, and when the same species, typically smaller fish. Many states have developed shore-based regulations where the minimum size is lower than in other areas and sectors to maintain opportunities in the shore angling sector.

## Risks to Managing Spatially: Coastwide

**Future considerations**

Distribution shifts caused by changes in thermal habitat and ocean circulation are likely to continue as long as long-term trends persist. Episodic and short-term events (see [2024 Highlights](#2024-highlights)) may increase variability in the trends, however species distributions are unlikely to reverse to historical ranges in the short term. Increased mechanistic understanding of distribution drivers is needed to better understand future distribution shifts: species with high mobility or short lifespans react differently from immobile or long lived species. 

Long-term oceanographic projections forecast a temporary pause in warming over the next decade due to internal variability in circulation and a southward shift of the Gulf Stream. Near-term forecasts are being evaluated to determine how well they are able to predict episodic and anomalous events that are outside of the long-term patterns.

.pull-left-70[
Adapting management to changing stock distributions and dynamic ocean processes will require continued monitoring of populations in space and evaluating management measures against a range of possible future spatial distributions. Processes like the [East Coast Climate Scenario Planning](https://www.mafmc.org/climate-change-scenario-planning),and subsequent formation of the [East Coast Climate Coordination Group](https://www.mafmc.org/e3cg), can help coordinate management.

## Risks to Setting Catch Limits *Edit this--presented last year*

Future considerations
*   There is a real risk that short-term predictions in assessments and rebuilding plans that assume unchanging underlying conditions will not be as effective, given the observed change documented in the prior sections in both ecological and environmental processes. 
*   Assumptions for species’ growth, reproduction, and natural mortality should continue to be evaluated for individual species. 
*   With observations of system-wide productivity shifts of multiple managed stocks, more research is needed to determine whether regime shifts or ecosystem reorganization are occurring, and how this should be incorporated into management.

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development: Implications

.pull-left[

```{r,  fig.height=2}
#code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-wind-proposed-dev.R"),

ecodata::plot_wind_dev_speed()
```


Implications:
*  Current plans for buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region 
*  Planned wind areas overlap with one of the only known right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.

???
* Despite some changes in the timeline, offshore wind developement is still ramping up and 2030 goals are expected to be met
  + Delays in some projects may mean that the development timeline is faster in coming years
* The staggered development in space and time means that impacts will affect regions differently and at different times
* Beyond fishery revenue some of the other major impacts include:
  + Protected species interactions, particularly NARW calf migration corridors as whale hotspots overlap with lease areas. This is particularly concerning for southern NE, especially during construction
  + The effects on federal surveys through operations, survey design, habitat modification, and navigation. There's an ongoing effort to better quantify and mitigate these impacts.
