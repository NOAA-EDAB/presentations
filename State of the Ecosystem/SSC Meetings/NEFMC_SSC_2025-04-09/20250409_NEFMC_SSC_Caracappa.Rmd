## Ecosystem synthesis themes

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** — large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

TOR:C2 performance metrics

- Status and trend are descriptive but don't provide a "desired state or trend"
- For instance commercial revenue is near the long-term average. Is that good? Is there another metric we want to assess how well that objective is being met?
- Example objective for commercial revenue: "Revenue stays above 1990 levels for 5 years and has a neutral or positive trend"
- Need to work on reference points among indicators with NEFMC

*  Changing spawning and migration timing
*  Multiple stocks with poor condition, declining productivity 

Other ocean uses: offshore wind development
*  Current revenue in proposed areas
    - 1-46% by Mid-Atlantic port
    - 2-16% by MAFMC managed species
*  Overlap with important right whale foraging habitats, increased vessel strike and noise risks

## Priority categories in the Request Memo

.pull-left-40[
The memo is organized into categories by topic, and categories are listed in descending order of overall (2022) priority based on approximate weighting within the category.

Therefore, a range of priority may be applied to individual requests within a category even though the entire category has an overall priority.

*The subgroup agreed to keep this group priority ranking*

*  System level thresholds/reference points: highest, much methods work in progress

*  Management: high, resource limited  
*  Short term forecasts: high, CEFI should help

] 

???
*System level thresholds/reference points*
Includes requests to develop analytical methods that can be applied across all indicator types and operationalized for management advice. Much of this high priority methodological work is in progress.
*Management*
Includes analyses related to management performance. Work on this category is resource limited.
*Short term forecasts*
Includes requests for biological and environmental forecasts. These forecasts may be forthcoming from CEFI products once they are tested. 
*Regime shifts*
Many analyses have been conducted and are in progress for individual ecosystem components, but a unifying framework with consistent methods is needed for the SOE.
*Multiple system drivers*
This category has the most requests. Most unranked requests from 2023 are in this category. Prioritization within this category is sorely needed.
*Functional group level status/thresholds/reference points*
Most of these requests are in progress. 
*Stock level indicators*
Requests for this information may be more appropriately directed to stock specific ecosystem products such as Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs).

## Discussion of 2023 and 2024 requests (1 of 2)

These newer requests were ranked highest within each category


*  System level thresholds/reference points: highest
    + maintain high priority on trend/threshold evaluation
    + express indicators relative to biological thresholds
    + standardize uncertainty language (IPCC)
    + longer term: simulation analysis of thresholds

*  Management: high  
    + include indicators for risk policy/risk assessment processes
    
*  Short term forecasts: high 
    + include CEFI projections
    
*  Regime shifts: high 
    + instead characterize current conditions in context of expected short term change

## Discussion of 2023 and 2024 requests (2 of 2)

These newer requests were ranked highest within each category

*  Multiple system drivers: moderate-high
    + profits vs revenue: provide incomplete net revenue and index of costs
    + clarify objectives and terminology for fishing community engagement/reliance
        + time series of community indicators
        + social and economic linkages to climate
        + consider appropriate scale for indicators

*  Functional group level status/thresholds/reference points: moderate
    + not specifically prioritized
    + include more aggregations for biomass and landings (Council-managed, status)

*  Stock level indicators: moderate, ESPs
    + not specifically prioritized 
    + cross reference ESP products where appropriate

Multiple drivers: ecosystem and stock production, management actions (stock rebuilding), market conditions (including COVID-19 disruptions), and environmental change

???
Although scallop decreases are partially explained by a decreased TAC, analyses suggest that the drop in landings is at least partially due to market disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, we do not anticipate the long-term declining trend in landings to change.

Drivers:
* Decline in commercial landings is most likely driven by actions to rebuild individual stocks (lower quotas) as well as market dynamics

## Risks to Managing Spatially: Coastwide

**Future considerations**

Distribution shifts caused by changes in thermal habitat and ocean circulation are likely to continue as long as long-term trends persist. Episodic and short-term events (see [2024 Highlights](#2024-highlights)) may increase variability in the trends, however species distributions are unlikely to reverse to historical ranges in the short term. Increased mechanistic understanding of distribution drivers is needed to better understand future distribution shifts: species with high mobility or short lifespans react differently from immobile or long lived species. 

Long-term oceanographic projections forecast a [temporary pause in warming](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL110946) over the next decade due to internal variability in circulation and a southward shift of the Gulf Stream. Near-term forecasts are being evaluated to determine how well they are able to predict episodic and anomalous events that are outside of the long-term patterns.

.pull-left-70[
Adapting management to changing stock distributions and dynamic ocean processes will require continued monitoring of populations in space and evaluating management measures against a range of possible future spatial distributions. Processes like the [East Coast Climate Scenario Planning](https://www.mafmc.org/climate-change-scenario-planning), and subsequent formation of the [East Coast Climate Coordination Group](https://www.mafmc.org/e3cg), can help coordinate management.

**How should forecasts be used within this report?**

## Risks to Setting Catch Limits

Future considerations
*   Processes that control fish productivity and mortality are dynamic, complex, and are the result of the interactions between multiple changing system drivers.
*   There is a real risk that short-term predictions in assessments and rebuilding plans that assume unchanging underlying conditions will not be as effective, given the observed change documented in the prior sections in both ecological and environmental processes. 
*   Assumptions for species’ growth, reproduction, and natural mortality should continue to be evaluated for individual species.

*   With observations of system-wide productivity shifts of multiple managed stocks, more research is needed to determine whether regime shifts or ecosystem reorganization are occurring, and how this should be incorporated into management.

Implications:
*  Current plans for buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region 
*  Planned wind areas overlap with one of the only known right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.

*  1-23% (Mid-Atlantic) or 1-34% (New England) of port revenue from fisheries currently comes from areas proposed for offshore wind development. Some communities have environmental justice concerns and gentrification vulnerability.
*  Up to 20% of annual commercial landings and revenue for Mid-Atlantic species occur in lease areas.
*  Up to 53% of annual commercial landings and 54% of revenue for New England species occur in lease areas.

Evaluating the impacts to scientific surveys has begun.
