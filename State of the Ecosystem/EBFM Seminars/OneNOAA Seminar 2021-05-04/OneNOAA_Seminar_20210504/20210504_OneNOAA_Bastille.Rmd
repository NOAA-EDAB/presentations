## Graphical summary of ecosystem synthesis themes, page 4

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** — large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

* Decline in recreational fleet diversity suggests a potentially reduced range of opportunities. 

* Driven by party/charter contraction (from a high of 24% of angler trips to 7% currently), and a shift toward shore based angling.

* Absence of a long-term trend in recreational effort suggests relative stability in the overall number of recreational opportunities in the MAB.

* Currently meeting objectives

* The downward trend in harbor porpoise bycatch can also be due to a decrease in harbor porpoise abundance in US waters, reducing their overlap with fisheries, and a decrease in gillnet effort. 

* The increasing trend in gray seal bycatch may be related to an increase in the gray seal population (U.S. pup counts).

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development
.pull-left[
Implications: 
* Current plans for rapid buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region  

* 1-12% of total average revenue for major New England commerical species in lease areas could be displaced if all sites are developed. Displaced fishing effort can alter fishing methods, which can in turn change habitat, species (managed and protected), and fleet interactions. 

* Right whales may be displaced, and altered local oceanography could affect distribution of their zooplankton prey.

* Scientific data collection surveys for ocean and ecosystem conditions, fish, and protected species will be altered, potentially increasing uncertainty for management decision making.

### How is this being used to inform management? 
<br />
<br />
* Feedback from FMCs

* Improvements for next year
 + Push to operationalize SOE
 + Standing up a subgroup

* MAFMC risk assessment

## Risk assessent indicators and ranking criteria: Commercial revenue 

This element is applied at the ecosystem level. Revenue serves as a proxy for commercial profits.
