### Why?

We report on ecosystem considerations to ensure *sustainable* management of living marine resources.

How can we develop ecosystem reporting to be:   
* efficient 
* targeted ecosystem reporting -and-
* informative to multiple aspects of the management process

---
## Who is the audience

* What information does the audience need for their decisions?
    + Do they need that much detail? 
    + Do they have the background to understand the implications of the message?
    + Could the information be more meaningful if applied elsewhere in the process?

---
## Who is the audience, cont'd

We probably don't need to provide the same ecosystem information to:
* Stock assessment scientists
* ICES ACOM / Science and Statistical Committees (USA)
* European Council / Fishery Management Council (USA)

But they each desperately need ecosystem reporting.

## Tiers of ecosystem reporting

* [Ecosystem Context for Stock Assessment](https://noaa-edab.github.io/ECSA/) 
    + Stock specific data that *might* influence recruitment, natural mortality, productivity, and etc.
    + Meant to start a conversation with stock assessment scientists
    + Can provide quantitative and/or qualitative information to the advisory process
* [State of the Ecosystem Report](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/SOE-NEFMC)
    + More holistic indicators on ecoregion spatial scales
    + Meant to inform SSC and Fishery Management Councils of patterns that might influence multiple stocks when providing advice
    + Can provide qualitative information to the advisory process
* [Ecosystem report cards](https://access.afsc.noaa.gov/reem/ecoweb/index.php?ID=1)
    + High-level information for non-scientists
    + Meant to inform those setting quota (or equivalent) of trends in indices
    + Can provide qualitative information to the advisory process

## But Scott, neither time nor resources are available!
* Probably true, so efficiency is key
* Back-end development is critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing data
* ICES data services are leading the pack
* Ditch .pdf, .ppt, and .docx for plain-text formats like markdown, rmarkdown, and xaringan
