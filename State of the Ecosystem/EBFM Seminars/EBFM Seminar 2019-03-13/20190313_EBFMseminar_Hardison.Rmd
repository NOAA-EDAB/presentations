## Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management

* Integrated management of a **single-sector** (i.e. fisheries)
* Considers trade-offs of management strategies on ecosystem components<sup>2</sup>



```{r ebfm-single-sector, fig.align="center", out.width = "50%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("20190313_EBFMseminar_Hardison_images/ebfm-single-sector.png")
```

???
Under EBM, the idea is that these "sectors" must be managed in an integrated fashion, where impacts of each sector on the ecosystem can be assessed and managed with respect to objectives

Ecosystem-based fishery management, or EBFM, is integrated management of a single sector, that is, fisheries.

EBFM considers trade-offs of management strategies on ecosystem components, within the fisheries sector

*The IEA Loop*

???
Before jumping in I'm going to start with some definitions of terms that you'll be hearing a lot of. The first is Integrated Ecosystem Assessmentor (IEA).

IEA is defined as a framework for the synthesis and analysis of relevant natural, social, and economic factors that are relevant to established management objectives.

IEA has been embraced on a nationwide scale by NOAA fisheries, and is a method for moving towards Ecosystem-Based Management for natural resources. 

It's an iterative process, hence, "the loop", and starts with the establishment of management goals by fishery management councils. 

Once objectives are defined, we develop indicators that allow us to quantify and report on the status and trends of ecosystem processes. 

Next we work with management bodies to identify sources of risk in ecosystems that threaten the achievement of management goals, and then we use modeling techniques to evaluate how certain management strategies could propagate through the system. 

Today I'm going to be talking to you about the ecosystem reporting phase of this process.

## Ecosystem Status Reporting (ESR)

Ecosystem reporting provides a route for ecosystem information to enter the stock assessment process

* Well-developed example is AFSC; whose ESRs have long served as context for North Pacific FMC quota 
deliberations<sup>1</sup>

All IEA regions in the US develop similar documents in varying guises

## Goals of ESR:

* Identify changes in ecosystem component status (short-term) and trend (long-term)

* Identify potential for changes to affect management concerns

* Highlight "red flags" and potential ecosystem state changes

![SOE-Network-Diagram](20190313_EBFMseminar_Hardison_images/SOE_Network_Diagram.png)

???
This network diagram provides an example of how primary production and environmental drivers are linked to a pelagic fishery and protected species.  

With ESRs, we want to describe these linkages and explain why they're important to managers. 

Nested within the pelagic fishery node in this diagram are the societal benefits derived from that fishery, linking social and economic ecosystem components to the base of the food web and environment.

---

## ESRs in the Northeast US: Relevance to management

**Why should managers care about an ecosystem perspective to resource management?**

--

Well-informed management decisions rely upon knowledge of the ecosystem being managed

An ecosystem perspective is important for managing in the face of rapid, unprecedented ecosystem changes

SST
Figure on left shows estimated time series of SST extending back to to 1850s. 
*7 out of 10 of the hottest years have been in the past decade

GSI
The figure on the right shows that deviation from the mean latitude of the north wall of the gulf stream, showing anomalously high value for the past 5 years

These things are important for managers to know about because they directly influence stock distribution dynamics

## ESRs in the Northeast US: Relevance to management

Fisheries yields are affected by ecosystem conditions<sup>1-3</sup>

Important ecosystem predictors of fisheries yield on global scale<sup>1</sup>:
* Sea surface temperature (-)
* Chlorophyll <i>a</i> (+)
* Particle export ratio (particles leaving euphotic zone:primary production) (+)
* Mesozooplankton productivity (+)

```{r chl-yield, echo = F, out.width = "50%"}

The figure here shows the relationship between chlorophyll a production in 52 large marine ecosystems around the world with fisheries yield in those systems.

So we know that these relationships exist, but drawing actionable place-based management advice from this information is difficult, but in the works here at the Center.

## ESR in the Northeast US

ESRs developed by NEFSC since 2009

Considerable support for EAFM exists in Northeast
* Most FMC members in the Northeast support transitioning from a single-species to a multi-species ecosystem approach (i.e. EBFM) to management<sup>1</sup>

--

Common refrain upon recieving ESR:
# "So what"?

---

## Problems with ESR model:

* Council members are busy people!

  * Long-documents with unfamiliar information unlikely to connect
  
* Not all Council members have science background

* "What does chlorophyll concentration tell us about fisheries yields?"

The disconnect inspired a new model, which we call **State of the Ecosystem (SOE)** reports

Question - We can't answer that question directly, but we can do a better job describing these ecosystem pathways 

---

## SOE Reporting: Ecosystem science for busy people

Addressing critiques to ESR model in SOE

1. Clear alignment of ecosystem components with management objectives

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Non-technical text

1. Short (< 30 pages), but rigorous

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 

```{r nes-comp2, echo = F, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("20190313_EBFMseminar_Hardison_images/nes-components-abstracted.png")
```

???
In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model


---
## SOE reporting: Quantifying change

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators**

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context<sup>1-3</sup>

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

While commercial fisheries have high specialization of catch, there's a positive long-term trend for recreational catch diversity in the recreational sector. 

Updated Marine Recreational Information Program data shows that there's been an upswing in harvest since the mid-90s, although the trend overall is negative

This corresponds with an increase in recreational effort since the mid-90s

Similar to NE, there's been a slight increase in recreational catch since the 90s in the Mid-Atlantic, along with a general increase in effort.

However, different from NE, there are significant downward trends in fleet effort diversity and diversity of catch. While a decline in fleet effort diversity is due to fewer party boats, we can't be sure why there's been a decline in diversity of catch, as South Atlantic FMC species are not tracked seperately.

The North Atlantic right whale is among the most endangered whales in the world, with less than 450 individuals remaining and declining abundance trends. Evidence suggests that interactions with fisheries are contributing to the decline of the fisheries. Between 2017 and 2018, there were 20 known right whale mortality events, and more than half of these were the direct result of entanglement or vessel strike. Right whale distributions may also be changing with climate related distribution shifts of their main food source, Calanus finmarchicus.

* Current bycatch levels suggest that management actions have been effective in reducing harbor porpoise bycatch

???
The maps here show density estimates of the widely distributed harbor porpoise in the spring and fall months, as estimated by the Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species.

The red line in the time series plot shows the potential biological removal. Above this line removals from the population will prevent the stock from reaching a stable population size. 

2016 and 2017 estimates for bycacth are among the lowest values in the series, suggest that management actions have been effective in reducing harbor porpoise bycatch.

Traditional fisheries management is based around stable species distributions, but those distributions aren't static, and especially not in the context of changing ecosystem conditions

The NEFSC has run a bottom trawl survey since the early 1960s, and these figures highlight how distributions of managed species within feeding guilds have changed. 

The decline in NEFMC species in the mid survey is driven mostly by ocean pout, which has seen proportional declines in the gulf of maine and georges bank survey

For the Mid, we show offshore bottom trawl survey data paired with inshore bottom trawl data collected in the region by Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program.

There appear to be opposing trends in spring piscivore biomass between the two surveys, which could reflect higher prevalence of spiny dogfish offshore

We didn't include the data in this presentation, but we also recieved inshore survey data from the Maine/New Hampshire survey and Mass state survey, and we hope to take a deeper look over the next SOE cycle

## SOE 2019: Fish and invertebrates
**Fish condition**

* Fish condition is measured at the weight at a given length relative to the average
  * Condition, or "fatness", is a factor that influences fecundity

*NEFMC Condition Factor*
```{r fish-con2, fig.align="center",out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("20190313_EBFMseminar_Hardison_images/NEFMC_Fish_Condition_2019.jpg")
```


???
Looking at condition in aggregate across all managed stocks, we can see a clear decline in condition between 2000-2010

Recent improvement within past decade

Interestingly, the drop-off in condition around 2000 resembles a shift in zooplankton size-structure on the shelf, and this is a topic for future research

## SOE 2019: Fish and invertebrates
**Fish productivity**

The fish productivity indicator shown here is the small fish per large fish biomass anomaly


```{r fish-prod, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width=8}
source("R/productivity_plots.R")
prod <- productivity_plots()
prod
```

???
In the Mid, there seems to be a decline in productivity in recent years, due to changes in recruitment and survival. 

In the past 5 years, strong productivity years for witch flounder, silver hake, and winter flounder have driven increases

---
## SOE 2019: Fish and invertebrates
**Larval diversity**
The last thing I'll talk about from the fish and intertebrates section is our metric of larval diversity, which was derived from the NEFSC Ecosystem Monitoring cruises. 

The diversity index tells us about the changing dominance of forage fish, hake, and haddock in the plankton

The most recent data we have for the Mid-Atlantic has shown the lowest larval estimates of larval diversity in the time series. As temperatures increase, there is a potential for a temporal mismatch of larvae with their zooplankton food sources, which could affect larval survival.

???
First indicator I'd like to talk about is a new water quality for Chesapeake Bay, which many resource species use as nursery habitat or are dependent upon (e.g. bluefish, striped bass, menhaden, black sea bass)

These data, which were provided by collaborators at the Chesapeake Bay Program, represent the percent of tidal waters in Chesapeake Bay meeting water quality standards for chlorophyll a, submerged aquatic vegetation, and dissolved oxygen. The increase in water quality for the Bay has been tied to management action limiting nutrient influx into the watershed.

These changes have implications for fish populations in the region that are already at the southern extent of their ranges, like Atlantic cod. Suitable habitat for these species is predicted to contract as waters continue to warm.

The same is true for the Mid-Atlantic Bight

## SOE 2019: Takeaways

* Even though the NE is "data rich", there are large gaps in our understanding of the system

--

* Changes in climate dynamics affect all nodes of NES network in different ways, but all have implications for human-ecosystem interactions and community well-being

--

* Making managers aware of the trends in ecosystem components is important for integrated and sustainable management strategies of the the fisheries sector (EBFM)

---
## SOE 2019: Reproducibility and provenance

* Reporting the information is not enough

* Managers appreciate the concise format, but back-end critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing
