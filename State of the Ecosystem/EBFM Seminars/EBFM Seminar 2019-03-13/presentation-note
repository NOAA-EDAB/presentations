What is ecosystem reporting?

1.  Ecosystem reporting provides ecosystem-context to resource managers - this is a key part of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (Zador et al. 2017)

* All Integrated Ecosystem Assessment regions in the US develop similar document in varying guises

Ecosystem Reporting in the Northeast US

* In the Northeast, we create State of the Ecosystem Reports
  - SOE reports are short (< 30 pages), higher-level documents aimed at sharing relavent ecosystem-information with resource managers
  - We provide these documents to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and New England Fishery Management Council on an annual basis

Ecosystem Reporting in the Northeast US

Used to highlight components of ecosystem that are changing, and ideally identify how those changes may propagate to other components. These components include...
    * Human dimensions
    * Oceanographic and lower trophic levels 
    * Macrofauna

Synthesis. We work to provide resource managers with information that binds ecosystem components together

Ecosystem Reporting in the Northeast US:

Quantifying ecosystem components

* The status and trends within ecosystem components are measured through *indicators*, which are developed to
1.  Be broadly informative about a component in a management context
2.  Minimize redundancy of information
3.  To be responsive to ecosystem change

The Northeast US is a data rich system in terms of available ecosystem information, and we have many indicators describing elements of each ecosystem component.

Why State of the Ecosystem reports?

* Ecosystem reporting in this shorter format is a good way to keep busy resource managers informed on ecosystem dynamics that are relevant to decisions being made on a single-species level (a form of EAFM)

* Any form of ecosystem based resource management (e.g. EAFM, EBFM, EBM) relies on a strong understanding of the system being managed.

  - Ecosystem reporting is one of the first steps to making this style of management, which the US is working to adapt, a reality.

  - Ecosystem information is more likely to be sought after if it's digestible and relevant - This is what the SOE strives for.

    * How do we know? Feedback from MAFMC and NEFMC suggests they find it valuable and would like it presented at least annually. 
  
* The flexible nature of what's included in the report from year to year, along with a programmatic workflow, make SOE reports effective in their capacity for reporting on both long-term trends and "red flags" occurring in ecosystems.

Why should managers care about ecosystem-level information?

Providing resource managers with contextual information about the ecosystems they work in is important for making well-informed decisions about the resource

1.  In terms of fisheries and primary production, marine ecosystems in high productivity states may be more resilient to extraction than those in lower productivity states. 

  * In addition, climate change will interact with ecosystem state to affect productivity

  * Therefore, Ecosystem approaches should be taken into account in management to maintain ecosystem resilience to these pressures

2.  The spatial and temporal shifts occurring in managed populations will benefit from management strategies that consider the forces driving changes (environmental, extractive)

  * For example, in the Northeast, the percentage of MAFMC managed species seen in Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank has been increasing in recent years.

  * Further, overall trends in N-S species distributions, mean depth of species, and distance of species from the coast has been changing over recent decades

  * Lobster in Gulf of Maine for climate-fisheries interaction?

3.  Ecosystem reporting informs the next steps in ecosystem-based methods for fisheries management.

  * EBFM is a way to reach goals of sustainable fisheries while conserving habitat and protected species under the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act.
  
  * SOE's inform risk assessments, which quantify the potential threats of changing ecosystem conditions to management goals.
  
    - In the Northeast, risk assessments have been used to prioritize ecosystem interactions within the summer flounder fishery (e.g. species - fleet - habitat - climate) in a conceptual model as a steps toward more comprehensive quantitative modeling
