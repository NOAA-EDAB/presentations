## Graphical summary of ecosystem synthesis themes, page 4

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** — large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

.pull-right[
Implications:

* Increased angler trips in 2020 relative to previous years strongly influence the long term increase in recreational effort. Recreational effort (angler trips) has increased over the long term, with 2020 effort above the long-term average.


* Decline in recreational fleet diversity suggests a potentially reduced range of opportunities. 

* Driven by party/charter contraction (from a high of 24% of angler trips to 7% currently), and a shift toward shore based angling.

Implications:  

* Population drivers for North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW) include combined fishery interactions/ship strikes, distribution shifts, and copepod availability.

* Additional potential stressors include offshore wind development, which overlaps with important habitat areas used year-round by right whales, including mother and calf migration corridors and foraging habitat.

* Unusual mortality events continue for 3 large whale species.

## Risks: Ecosystem productivity

Implications: fluctuating environmental conditions and prey for forage species affect both abundance and energy content. Energy content varies by season, and has changed over time most dramatically for Atlantic herring

Implications: 
Most species in the MAB had below average or poor condition again in 2021. Preliminary results of synthetic analyses show that changes in temperature, zooplankton, fishing pressure, and population size influence the condition of different fish species.

Implications: No trend in aggregate sharks and HMS populations mainly at or above taget. Stable predator populations suggest stable predation pressure on managed species, but increasing seal populations may reflect increasing predation pressure.

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development 

.pull-left[
Implications: 

*  Current plans for rapid buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region.

*  Development will affect species differently, negatively affecting species that prefer soft bottom habitat while potentially benefiting species that prefer hard structured habitat.

*  Up to 20% of annual commercial landings and revenue for Mid-Atlantic species occur in lease areas.
