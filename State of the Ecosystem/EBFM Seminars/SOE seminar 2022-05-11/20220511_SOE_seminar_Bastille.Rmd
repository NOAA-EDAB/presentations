Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

Coastwide landings at the Federal fishery management plan (FMP) level were mixed in 2020 when compared to recent years. Landings of groundfish were up, while monkfish and scallop were down.  Lobster landings also decreased in 2020.*
