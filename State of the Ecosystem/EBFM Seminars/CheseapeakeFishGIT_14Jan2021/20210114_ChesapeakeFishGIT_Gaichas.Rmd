Meeting Purpose:
● Deliver emerging science and improve cross-jurisdictional collaboration to improve
fishery management decisions
● Lead forums that bring the management and science communities together to learn
about the latest fisheries and habitat science, discuss management implications, identify
new science priorities, and identify funding opportunities
Presentation Content:
● Keep in mind - we want to ensure presentations are palatable and engaging for a broad
membership audience.
● Points of focus:
○ Importance of research
○ Key findings or updates
○ Connections to management implications
○ New arising questions and next steps
● Points to generally avoid:
○ Technical slides focusing on project methodology
■ Feel free to still include method slides (at the end of your presentation) to
have as an available resource during group discussion

The Council’s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop on slide 2. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

## State of the Ecosystem (SOE) Reporting: Context for busy people

*"So what?" --John Boreman, September 2016*

1. Clear linkage of ecosystem indicators with management objectives

1. Synthesis across indicators for big picture

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Short (< 30 pages), non-technical (but rigorous) text

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 


???
In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model

* The fraction of ecosystem energy removed by fisheries is declining (commercial landings declined while primary production remained steady) 

* Commercial fishing engagement has declined for medium-highly engaged communities, possibly linked to continued declines in revenue 

* Recreational retained catch was lowest observed in 2018, and effort has been declining along with fleet effort diversity  

* Recreational catch diversity has been maintained by SAFMC/ASMFC species

* Habitat models identified species most likely to occur in wind lease areas; habitat has improved in wind lease areas for these MAFMC species 

* While aggregate fish biomass is stable over time, shifts to the northeast and into deeper water continue 

* Forage fish energy content varies by season and year; herring energy content may be half what it was in the 1980s-90s

* Heavy rains put unprecedented fresh water and nutrients into Chesapeake Bay in 2018-2019, increasing oyster mortality and spreading invasive catfish

* Gulf stream instability produces more warm core rings with higher likelihood of warm salty water and associated species on the shelf

* Marine surface water heatwaves are increasing in duration and intensity, bottom temperatures and the cold pool are warming

* Warmer waters increase nutrient recycling and summer primary production

## Proposed ecosystem synthesis themes for 2021

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management: plain language summary for 2 pager

* Multiple drivers of abundance, defined by the competing factors that influence the amount of fish in the ocean; 
* Regime shifts, or ecosystem change can happen rapidly as multiple drivers change; and, 
* Reorganization of the ecosystem, multiple factors that interact that change the structure and organization of the ecosystem, e.g. Tropicalization

Conceptual model links indicators in the report with management objectives.

A subset of objectives are currently under investigation using GAMs and hedonic price functions. We plan to extend this work with structural equation modeling and or other methods in 2020.
