	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

	abstract = {We explored alternative status determination criteria and reference points that could simplify fisheries management using a simulated multispecies/ecosystem-based operational management procedure. There are four components to the procedure: (i) limit total removals from the ecosystem; (ii) allocate the total removals limit among aggregate species groups; (iii) maintain individual species above minimum stock size thresholds; and (iv) optimize the species mix (within aggregates) based on bio-economic portfolio analysis. In this procedure, “overfishing” criteria are applied only to aggregates of species at the ecosystem and group level, but “overfished” criteria apply at the species/stock level. Previous work using multispecies production models identified conditions where conservation and yield objectives could be balanced: aggregations of species with similar life histories, species interactions, and responses to environmental forcing supported the highest yields while minimizing risks that individual stocks dropped below biomass thresholds. Here, we use a more complex length structured multispecies, multifleet simulation model to explore management procedure steps (i)–(iii). Different species aggregation rules were applied (single species, functional groups, and full system), and yield curves were constructed for each aggregation level by sequentially increasing effort in each of the fleets (alone and simultaneously), while recruitment for each species varied stochastically around a function based on spawning stock biomass. The performance of individual species and each aggregate type was then compared with respect to yield, biomass, and economic revenue objectives under changing environmental conditions. Our results evaluate the trade-offs between these objectives for the 10 species in the simulated system. Overall we found that there are aggregate catch limits that can both maximize yield and revenue while conserving biomass. However, community composition and revenue trade-off over a range of fishing effort. We consider this a starting point for further development with scientists, managers, fishermen, and other stakeholders in the region.},

Even for fisheries with excellent data collection programs, scientific surveys and sophisticated assessments, the estimates of catch levels that will maintain healthy fisheries or rebuild depleted ones are often far from accurate. Consequently recommended catch levels often fluctuate more than necessary in response to error in assessments rather than true stock variability and frequently react too slowly due to lags in data collection, assessment and implementation. Overly optimistic estimates of stock size and future growth have often led to allowing catch levels that undermine rebuilding. Fishery management strategies also rarely include specific objectives developed with stakeholder involvement which can undermine stakeholders‘ support for conservation even when it may be in their best interest.},

A stakeholder driven management  strategy evaluation (MSE) was conducted that incorporated a broad range  of objectives. The MSE process was completed within one year. Constant  catch, conditional constant catch, and a biomass-based (BB) HCR with a  15\% restriction on the interannual change in the quota could achieve  more stable yields than BB HCRs without such restrictions, but could not  attain as high of yields and resulted in more negative outcomes for  terns (a herring predator). A similar range of performance could be  achieved by applying a BB HCR annually, every three years, or every five  years. Predators (i.e., dogfish, tuna, and terns) were generally  insensitive to the range of HCRs. While median net revenues were  sensitive to some HCRs, most HCRs produced a stable equilibrium of net revenue. In order to meet  management needs, some aspects of the simulations were less than might  be considered scientifically ideal, but using models of intermediate  complexity formed a foundation for future improvements.},

Conducting an open MSE aligns well with publicly-driven management but requires clear goals and communication. Investment in effective organizers, impartial facilitators, and knowledgeable analysts can improve communication and understanding of MSE, to the betterment of fisheries management. We aim to further MSE best practices on integrating stakeholders and hope that our lessons learned on communication, engagement, and integration of MSE into an existing management arena will be useful to other practitioners.},

	abstract = {Having a realistic representation of ecosystems in fisheries models is important in the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). While different modelling approaches support EBFM, accounting for trophic interactions and uncertainty in stock dynamics is important for management advice. Multispecies models exist, but are rarely used for assessments. Most stock assessments are single species models and predation is subsumed into natural mortality, which is often an assumed known value. The use of state-space assessment models, which account for stochasticity in unobserved processes (process errors), is increasing. However, many stocks are managed assuming deterministic processes. Little is known of how ignoring predation and process errors in stock assessment can impact the perception of the stocks and therefore fisheries management. We developed an age-structured multispecies operating model that simulated data with errors in observations, recruitment and fish abundance. Four estimation models (EMs) that differed according to whether or not they accounted for predation or process errors were fitted to the simulated data. Relative differences between true and predicted outputs were estimated as a measure of bias. Equilibrium unfished biomass was estimated for each model as a proxy reference point. Ignoring predation had the largest impact on stock perception and resulted in large bias in parameters, derived outputs and absolute or relative reference points. Estimating unobserved processes was not sufficient in limiting the bias when natural mortality was misspecified. Ignoring process errors had limited bias but the bias increased when no contrasts existed in fishing mortality over time. Looking solely at likelihood values to choose among models is misleading and predictive ability could be used to prevent selecting models that overfit the data. Synthesis and applications. Ignoring trophic interactions that occur in marine ecosystems induces bias in stock assessment outputs and results in low model predictive ability with subsequently biased reference points. While it may be difficult to estimate natural mortality when no data exist to inform it, stock managers should remember that, if predation is large, assuming a constant mortality over time and/or age could have large consequences on stock perception and reference point estimates and affect resulting management advice.},

In 2006, the US Congress required the implementation of annual catch limits (ACLs) and accountability measures by 2010 to prevent overﬁshing, and by 2011 to recover overﬁshed stocks. These requirements were modelled on the existing management system for Northeast Paciﬁc groundﬁsh, where more than 20 ﬁsh stocks and assemblages have been managed sustainably for 30 years. Science-based overﬁshing levels and acceptable biological catches (ABCs) have been implemented for each stock or assemblage, with buffers between the two to avoid overﬁshing. Total allowable catches are set at or below the acceptable biological catch. Suballocations of quotas by season, area, and gear type, along with in-season ﬁshery closures based on extensive observer coverage and vessel monitoring, ensure that quotas are not exceeded. To comply with ACL requirements, the North Paciﬁc Fishery Management Council has deﬁned ABC as an ACL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACLs for successful management of Northeast Paciﬁc groundﬁsh, suggesting that their use in other US ﬁsheries might reduce the risk of overﬁshing and enhance the recovery of overﬁshed stocks.},

Overarching principles are that ﬁshing mortality rates should not jeopardize the capacity of a stock to produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and that overﬁshed stocks (i.e. biomass is too low) should be rebuilt to the level that will support MSY. The science-based system for achieving sustainable ﬁsheries is implemented, in part, through setting annual catch limits (ACLs) that cannot exceed the acceptable biological catch that is recommended by Scientiﬁc and Statistical Committees using methods that account for scientiﬁc uncertainty. Accountability measures (AMs) are management measures to prevent ACLs from being exceeded or correct any overages that occur. Implementation in 2012 of ACLs and AMs in all Federal ﬁsheries was a historical achievement in the United States; one that will help rebuild stocks and ensure sustainable ﬁsheries into the future. Some remaining challenges include: determining appropriate catch levels and management approaches for stocks with incomplete data; assessing more stocks, more frequently; addressing differences between managing stocks as a complex vs. managing individual stocks in a multistock ﬁshery; and incorporating social and economic factors in determining the appropriate response to uncertainty.},

Under high-baseline carbon emission scenarios (RCP 8.5), end-of-century (2075–2100) pollock and Pacific cod fisheries collapse in {\textgreater}70\% and {\textgreater}35\% of all simulations, respectively. Our analysis suggests that 2.1–2.3 °C (modeled summer bottom temperature) is a tipping point of rapid decline in gadid biomass and catch. Multiyear stanzas above 2.1 °C become commonplace in projections from {\textasciitilde}2030 onward, with higher agreement under RCP 8.5 than simulations with moderate carbon mitigation (i.e., RCP 4.5). We find that EBFM ameliorates climate change impacts on fisheries in the near-term, but long-term EBFM benefits are limited by the magnitude of anticipated change.},

	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) provides a simulation framework to test the performance of living marine resource management. MSE has now been adopted broadly for use in single-species fishery management, often using a relatively simple “operating model” that projects population dynamics of one species forward in time. However, many challenges in ecosystem-based management involve tradeoffs between multiple species and interactions of multiple stressors. Here we use complex operating models, multi-species ecosystem models of the California Current and Nordic and Barents Seas, to test threshold harvest control rules that explicitly address the linkage between predators and prey, and between the forage needs of predators and fisheries. Specifically, within Atlantis ecosystem models we focus on how forage (zooplankton) availability affects the performance of harvest rules for target fish, and how these harvest rules for fish can account for environmentally-driven fluctuations in zooplankton. Our investigation led to three main results. First, consistent with studies based on single-species operating models, we found that compared to constant F = FMSY policies, threshold rules led to higher target stock biomass for Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) in the California Current and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Nordic and Barents Seas. Performance in terms of catch of these species varied depending partly on the biomass and recovery trajectory for the simulated stock. Secondly, the multi-species operating models and the harvest control rules that linked fishing mortality rates to prey biomass (zooplankton) led to increased catch variability; this stemmed directly from the harvest rule that frequently adjusted Pacific hake or mackerel fishing rates in response to zooplankton, which are quite variable in these two ecosystems. Thirdly, tests suggested that threshold rules that increased fishing when productivity (zooplankton) declined had the potential for strong ecosystem effects on other species. These effects were most apparent in the Nordic and Barents Seas simulations. The tests of harvest control rules here do not include uncertainty in monitoring of fish and zooplankton, nor do they include uncertainty in stock assessment and implementation; these would be required for full MSE. Additionally, we intentionally chose target fish with strong mechanistic links to particular zooplankton groups, with the simplifying assumption that zooplankton biomass followed a forced time series. Further developing and testing of ecosystem-level considerations can be achieved with end-to-end ecosystem models, such as the Atlantis models applied here, which have the added benefit of tracking the follow-on effects of the harvest control rule on the broader ecosystem.},
