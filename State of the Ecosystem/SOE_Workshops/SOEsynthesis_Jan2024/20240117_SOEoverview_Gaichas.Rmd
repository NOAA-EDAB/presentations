Fig 4. Mean occupancy habitats at the 20% (light blue) and 80% (dark blue) quantile thresholds across forage species; gray shows the model extent. Taxa with autumn models include (D) Round Herring, (E) longfin inshore squid, (F) Atlantic Chub Mackerel, (G) Spanish Sardine, (H) Butterfish, and (I) Atlantic Thread Herring. Offshore wind lease areas are outlined in red. The dashed line marks the 100-m depth contour.

## Distribution shifts: Implications

*  Allocations/species availability based on previous distributions no longer work
*  Species interactions - by catch
*  Movement of protected species, new overlaps with fisheries
*  Survey catchability
*  Expect declines in forage fish and NARW foraging with declines in Calanus (GOM)

Could result in mismatch if prey and predator shifts are not synchronized'

Survey catchability nonstationary

-   Zooplankton productivity
    -   Calanus lipids (GOM)
    -   Zooplankton composition

*  Predation (indices of predator status/abundance)
]

## Productivity change: Implications

Ecosystem overfishing (i.e. changes in the amount of productivity that can sustainably be removed from the system)
Periods of low condition indicate poor health, possibly leading to slower growth and lower recruitment success

## Risks to Quota Management/Rebuilding

MORTALITY/Physiological change

Biological Observations
*  Changes in metabolic rates (growth, condition, reproduction)
*  Disease
*  Mortality
*  Energy content
