## Ecosystem synthesis themes

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

## Recent short term trends assessed

Andy's [`arfit` R package](https://noaa-edab.github.io/arfit/articles/background_work.html) integrated into `ecodata`

Tests for significant trend, null hypothesis is mean with autocorrelation (no trend)

Apply to most recent 10 years of each dataset

## No more polynomial long term trends assessed

Decision based on how strange some of them looked

Has implications for risk assessment scoring

## Priority categories in the Request Memo

.pull-left-40[
The memo is organized into categories by topic, and categories are listed in descending order of overall (2022) priority based on approximate weighting within the category.

Therefore, a range of priority may be applied to individual requests within a category even though the entire category has an overall priority.

*The subgroup agreed to keep this group priority ranking*

.pull-right-60[
*  System level thresholds/reference points: highest, much methods work in progress

*  Management: high, resource limited  
*  Short term forecasts: high, CEFI should help  
*  Regime shifts: high, need system level framework 

*  Multiple system drivers: moderate-high, many unranked requests  

*  Functional group level status/thresholds/reference points: moderate, many in progress
*  Stock level indicators: moderate, ESPs better venue

*  SOE administration: unranked  

] 

???
*System level thresholds/reference points*
Includes requests to develop analytical methods that can be applied across all indicator types and operationalized for management advice. Much of this high priority methodological work is in progress.
*Management*
Includes analyses related to management performance. Work on this category is resource limited.
*Short term forecasts*
Includes requests for biological and environmental forecasts. These forecasts may be forthcoming from CEFI products once they are tested. 
*Regime shifts*
Many analyses have been conducted and are in progress for individual ecosystem components, but a unifying framework with consistent methods is needed for the SOE.
*Multiple system drivers*
This category has the most requests. Most unranked requests from 2023 are in this category. Prioritization within this category is sorely needed.
*Functional group level status/thresholds/reference points*
Most of these requests are in progress. 
*Stock level indicators*
Requests for this information may be more appropriately directed to stock specific ecosystem products such as Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs).

## Discussion of 2023 and 2024 requests (1 of 2)

These newer requests were ranked highest within each category


*  System level thresholds/reference points: highest
    + maintain high priority on trend/threshold evaluation
    + express indicators relative to biological thresholds
    + standardize uncertainty language (IPCC)
    + longer term: simulation analysis of thresholds

*  Management: high  
    + include indicators for risk policy/risk assessment processes
    
*  Short term forecasts: high 
    + include CEFI projections
    
*  Regime shifts: high 
    + instead characterize current conditions in context of expected short term change

## Discussion of 2023 and 2024 requests (2 of 2)

These newer requests were ranked highest within each category

*  Multiple system drivers: moderate-high
    + profits vs revenue: provide incomplete net revenue and index of costs
    + clarify objectives and terminology for fishing community engagement/reliance/EEJ
        + time series of community indicators
        + social and economic linkages to climate
        + consider appropriate scale for indicators

*  Functional group level status/thresholds/reference points: moderate
    + not specifically prioritized
    + include more aggregations for biomass and landings (Council-managed, status)

*  Stock level indicators: moderate, ESPs
    + not specifically prioritized 
    + cross reference ESP products where appropriate
