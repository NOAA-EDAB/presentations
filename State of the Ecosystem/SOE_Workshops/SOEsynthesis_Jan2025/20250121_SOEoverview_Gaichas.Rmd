## Ecosystem synthesis themes: still framing! but replace p.3 with 2024 Overview

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

Climate: warming and changing oceanography continue

*  Estuarine, coastal, and offshore habitats affected, with range of species responses
*  Distribution shifts complicate management
*  Multiple fish with poor condition, declining productivity 

Other ocean uses: offshore wind development
*  Current revenue in proposed areas
    - 1-34% by port (some with EJ concerns)
    - up to 17% by managed species
*  Different development impacts for species preferring soft bottom vs. hard bottom 
*  Overlap with important right whale foraging habitats, increased vessel strike and noise risks 
*  Rapid buildout in patchwork of areas 
*  Scientific survey mitigation required
