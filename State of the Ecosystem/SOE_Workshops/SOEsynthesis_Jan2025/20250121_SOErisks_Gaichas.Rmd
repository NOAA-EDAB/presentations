## Risks to Spatial Management

Future considerations

*   Distribution shifts caused by changes in thermal habitat are likely to continue as long as long-term temperature trends persist. 
*   Near-term oceanographic forecasts are currently in development and may inform how future warming impacts species distributions.
*   Increased oceanographic variability needs to be captured by regional ocean models and linked to species distribution processes to better understand potential future distributions. Species with high mobility or short lifespans react differently from immobile or long lived species.

Adapting management to changing stock distributions and dynamic ocean processes will require continued monitoring of populations in space and evaluating management measures against a range of possible future spatial distributions. 

*   [East Coast Climate Scenario Planning](https://www.mafmc.org/climate-change-scenario-planning) can help coordinate management.
*   [Near term predictions of distribution shifts](https://www.lenfestocean.org/nb/news-and-publications/multimedia/crafting-models-to-predict-near-term-fisheries-shifts-under-climate-change) project in progress

## Risks to Quota Setting/Rebuilding

Future considerations
*   There is a real risk that short-term predictions in assessments and rebuilding plans that assume unchanging underlying conditions will not be as effective, given the observed change documented in the prior sections in both ecological and environmental processes. 
*   Assumptions for species’ growth, reproduction, and natural mortality should continue to be evaluated for individual species. 
*   With observations of system-wide productivity shifts of multiple managed stocks, more research is needed to determine whether regime shifts or ecosystem reorganization are occurring, and how this should be incorporated into management.
