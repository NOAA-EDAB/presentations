## Ecosystem synthesis themes: emphasize throughout document

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

* ecosystem composition and production changes

]


???
Because ecosystem overfishing seems unlikely, stock status is mostly acceptable, and aggregate biomass trends appear stable, the decline in commercial landings is most likely driven by market dynamics affecting the landings of surfclams and ocean quahogs, as quotas are not binding for these species.

Climate change also seems to be shifting the distribution of surfclams and ocean quahogs, resulting in areas with overlapping distributions and increased mixed landings. Given the regulations governing mixed landings, this could become problematic in the future and is currently being evaluated by the Council.

* Absence of a long-term trend in recreational effort suggests relative stability in the overall number of recreational opportunities in the MAB.

* 2021 Memo 22-23, Cumulative weather index and management complexity drivers under construction
]

???
Changes in recreational fleet diversity can be considered when managers seek options to maintain recreational opportunities. Shore anglers will have access to different species than vessel-based anglers, and when the same species, typically smaller fish. Many states have developed shore-based regulations where the minimum size is lower than in other areas and sectors to maintain opportunities in the shore angling sector.

???
While larval and adult fish diversity indices are stable, a few warm-southern larval species are becoming more dominant. Increasing zooplankton diversity is driven by declining dominance of an important species, which warrants continued monitoring.

Implications: Highlighted communities may be vulnerable to changes in fishing patterns due to regulations and/or climate change. When any of these communities are also experiencing social vulnerability, they may have lower ability to successfully respond to change. These indicators may also point to communities that are vulnerable to environmental justice issues.

Implications: Highlighted communities may be vulnerable to changes in fishing patterns due to regulations and/or climate change. When any of these communities are also experiencing social vulnerability, they may have lower ability to successfully respond to change. These indicators may also point to communities that are vulnerable to environmental justice issues.

* The downward trend in harbor porpoise bycatch can also be due to a decrease in harbor porpoise abundance in US waters, reducing their overlap with fisheries, and a decrease in gillnet effort. 

* The increasing trend in gray seal bycatch may be related to an increase in the gray seal population (U.S. pup counts).

Implications: increased production by smaller phytoplankton implies less efficient transfer of primary production to higher trophic levels. Monitor implications of increasing gelatinous zooplankton and krill.
]

  
???
Increased temperatures, as reported above, can increase the rate of photosynthesis by phytoplankton (i.e. primary productivity). Annual primary production has increased over time, primarily driven by increased productivity in the summer months. 

Larger zooplankton (i.e. *Calanus finmarchicus*) had above average abundance in 2018-2019, while smaller-bodied copepods were near or below average.

* Harbor and gray seals are generalist predators that consume more than 30 different prey species: red, white and silver hake, sand lance, yellowtail flounder, four-spotted flounder, Gulf-stream flounder, haddock, herring, redfish, and squids.-->

Implications: stable predator populations suggest stable predation pressure on managed species, but increasing predator populations may reflect increasing predation pressure.

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development 
<!--&emsp; Element: OceanUse-->

.pull-left[
Implications (2021--uupdate): 
* Current plans for rapid buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region  

* 2-24% of total average revenue for major Mid-Atlantic commercial species in lease areas could be displaced if all sites are developed. Displaced fishing effort can alter fishing methods, which can in turn change habitat, species (managed and protected), and fleet interactions. 

* Right whales may be displaced, and altered local oceanography could affect distribution of their zooplankton prey.

* Scientific data collection surveys for ocean and ecosystem conditions, fish, and protected species will be altered, potentially increasing uncertainty for management decision making.

# Discussion
.pull-left[
1. This draft based on last year, not complete
1. Maintain structure, update based on requests
1. Further develop synthesis themes: multiple drivers, regime shifts, system reorganization
1. Note updates to be included as Request Memo points
    - What has been included this year
    - What is in progress
    - What has less progress
    - What feedback/clarification would help contributors

# Thank you!

SOE has been like an annual benchmark with new data and structure... hold pattern for a few years?
