## What are Risk Elements, how are they determined, and potential considerations

.center[
# Key Definitions  


## Risk Elements: *what are we measuring?* 

## Risk Definition: *why are we measuring it?*

## Indicator: *how are we measuring it?*

## Risk Ranking Criteria: *what is the risk?*

Assessment currently framed around risks to meeting Council management objectives: 

Optimum yield (OY); supporting seafood production, recreational opportunities, and community and fishery resilience; minimizing bycatch and protected species interactions

   * Direct link between ecosystem reporting and risk assessment
   * Conceptual model links across risk elements for fisheries, species
   * Management strategy evaluation includes key risks

]
???
The Councilâ€™s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.
