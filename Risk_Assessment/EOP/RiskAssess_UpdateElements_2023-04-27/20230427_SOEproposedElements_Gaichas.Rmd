## State of the Ecosystem information in support of current or put aside elements

*   Estuarine habitat indicators: link to climate risks for estuarine dependent species?
*   Offshore habitat indicators: link to climate  or distribution shift risks for all species?
*   ABC/ACL compared with catch: quantify

## State of the Ecosystem information in support of new elements

*   Recreational fleet diversity -- fishery resilience or recreational opportunity risk?
*   Changes in fishing engagement -- fishery resilience risk?
*   Commercial and recreational community vulnerability: social, gentrification, environmental justice

*   Habitat climate vulnerability

*   Offshore wind specific elements -- risks to revenue by species and port?

## Recreational opportunity risk

.pull-left[
### Recreational Fleet Diversity (2019-2023)
Recreational diversity indices could be considered as additional risk element(s) to complement the existing Commercial fishery resilience (revenue diversity) element. While recreational value measured as angler trips has gone from high risk to low-moderate risk based on updated data, recreational fleet diversity (i.e., effort by shoreside, private boat, and for-hire anglers) has declined over the long term.

## Social-Cultural Risk elements 

.pull-left[

### Commerical Fishery Engagement Trends (2020)
Commercial fishery engagement measures the [number of permits, dealers, and landings in a community](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/socioeconomics/social-indicator-definitions#fishing-engagement-and-reliance-indices). The trend in the number of Mid-Atlantic fishing communities that were highly engaged in commercial fishing has shown a decrease since 2004. Significant changes in engagement scores have also been observed in medium-highly engaged communities. The average engagement score has decreased since 2004. These changes may be driven by the decline in value landed by primary species such as sea scallops in this group of communities. 

] 

.pull-right[
### Social Vulnerability, Commercial and Recreational engagement and reliance by community (2021)
Social vulnerability measures social factors that shape a community’s ability to adapt to change and does not consider gentrification pressure (see [detailed definitions](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/socioeconomics/social-indicator-definitions)). Communities that ranked medium-high or above for one or more of the following indicators: poverty, population composition, personal disruption, or labor force structure, were highlighted.

## Social-Cultural Risk elements: Environmental justice vulnerability (2022-2023)

.pull-left[
```{r commercial-engagement, fig.cap= "Commercial engagement, reliance, and social vulnerability for the top commercial fishing communities in the Mid-Atlantic.", code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-commercial-engagement.R"), fig.width = 6.5, fig.asp = 0.75}
```

.pull-right[

```{r recreational-engagement, fig.cap= "Recreational engagement, reliance, and social vulnerability for the top recreational fishing communities in the Mid-Atlantic.", code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-recreational-engagement.R"), fig.width = 6.5, fig.asp = 0.75}
```

]

These indicators highlighted in the 2022 Risk Assessment update showed signals of increased recreational fishing engagement and reliance in the Mid-Atlantic during 2020 (likely in response to COVID-19) as reported in the 2023 SOE. Combinations of these updated indicators can be used to update and expand on the **Social-Cultural** risk element.

## Fish habitat overlap with offshore wind lease areas (2020)

Fish habitat modeling based on NEFSC bottom trawl surveys indicates that summer flounder, butterfish, longfin squid, and spiny dogfish are among fish species highly likely to occupy wind energy lease areas. Habitat conditions for many of these species have become more favorable over time within wind lease areas (increasing trend in probability of occupancy). The table lists the top 5 species in each season most likely to occupy the wind lease areas in the northern, central, and southern portions of the MAB, along with observed trends in probability of occupancy.

## Offshore wind energy development timeline (2021-2023)
As of January 2023, 24 offshore wind development projects are proposed for construction over the next decade in the Northeast (timelines and project data are based on Tables E-2, E-4, and E-4-2 of South Fork Wind Farm Final Environmental Impact Statement). Offshore wind areas are anticipated to cover more than 2.3 million acres by 2030 in the Greater Atlantic region (Fig. \ref{fig:wind-proposed-dev}). Beyond 2030 values include acreage for future areas in the Central Atlantic  and Gulf of Maine Area planning area for floating research array.

## Offshore wind energy revenue by species in lease areas (2021-2023)
.pull-left[

Based on federal vessel logbook data, commercial fishery revenue from trips in the current offshore wind lease areas and the draft Central Atlantic Bight Primary and Secondary Call Areas have varied annually from 2008-2021, with less than \$1 million in revenue overlapping with these areas for most fisheries. However, some fisheries see periodic spikes in revenue overlap with wind energy lease areas, including up to \$4.7 million affected in the surfclam fishery and nearly $4.3 million affected in the longfin squid fishery in 2008 and 2016, respectively.(Fig. \ref{fig:wea-spp-rev}).

## Port revenue from WEAs and environmental justice risks (2022-2023)
.pull-left[

Equity and environmental justice (EJ) are priority concerns with offshore wind development and fisheries impacts in the Northeast. The presented indicator links historic port revenue (2008-2021) from within all wind lease areas as a proportion of the port’s total revenue based on vessel trip reports as described in the revenue and landings of species in the wind indicator above. The range (minimum and maximum) of total percent revenue from within wind energy areas is presented in the graph and ports are sorted from greatest to least revenue from within wind areas.

## WEAs and risks to protected species: Right whale habitat
Planned development overlaps right whale mother and calf migration corridors and a significant foraging habitat that is used throughout the year. Turbine presence and extraction of energy from the system could alter local oceanography and may affect right whale prey availability. Proposed wind development areas also bring increased vessel strike risk from construction and operation vessels. In addition, there are a number of potential impacts to whales from pile driving and operational noise such as displacement, increased levels of communication masking, and elevated stress hormones.
