Herring were linked to 3 sensitive predator types with adequate data to justify modeling; no exisitng model addressed all objectives and analytical time was limited to &lt;1 year.
Three control rule types--Constant catch, conditional constant catch, and 15% restriction on change--were rejected at the second stakeholder meeting for poor fishery and predator performance.
Supplemental food web modeling showed tradeoffs between forage groups

* Working group of habitat, biology, stock assessment, management, economic and social scientists developed:

  * draft conceptual models of high risk elements, linkages
  * dataset identification and gap analysis for each element and link
  * draft questions that the Council could persue with additional work
]  
* Final conceptual model and supporting information at December 2019 Council meeting

* Council may then elect to proceed with management strategy evaluation (MSE) using the information from conceptual modeling as a basis

## Standardized indicator visualization in reports

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators** and plotted in a standardized way

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context&lt;sup&gt;1-3&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

## Risk assessent indicators and ranking criteria: System productivity

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and ranks the risk of not achieving optimum yield due to changes in ecosystem productivity at the base of the food web.

Four indicators are used together to assess risk of changing ecosystem productivity: primary production, zooplankton abundance, fish condition and fish recruitment. 

.table[

| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trends in ecosystem productivity |
| Low-Moderate | Trend in ecosystem productivity (1-2 measures, increase or decrease) |
| Moderate-High | Trend in ecosystem productivity (3+ measures, increase or decrease) |
| High | Decreasing trend in ecosystem productivity, all measures |
]
???
We examine trends in total primary production, zooplankton abundance for a key Mid-Atlantic species, and two aggregate fish productivity measures: condition factor (weight divided by length of individual fish) and a survey based "recruitment" (small fish to large fish) index.
