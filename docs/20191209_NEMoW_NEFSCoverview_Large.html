## Mid-Atlantic Council Ecosystem Approach

* 2016 Ecosystem Approach to Fishery Management (EAFM) Policy Guidance document:
http://www.mafmc.org/s/EAFM-Doc-Revised-2019-02-08.pdf

* Mid-Atlantic EAFM framework&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:

&lt;img src="EDAB_images/Framework.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Details on development, including workshop presentations and white papers:

## How are they using the risk assessment? What's next?
.pull-left[
* Based on risk assessment, the Council selected summer flounder as high-risk fishery for conceptual modeling

&lt;img src="EDAB_images/Framework.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
.pull-right[
* Working group of habitat, biology, stock assessment, management, economic and social scientists developed:

  * draft conceptual models of high risk elements, linkages
  * dataset identification and gap analysis for each element and link
  * draft questions that the Council could persue with additional work
]  
* Final conceptual model and supporting information at December 2019 Council meeting

* Council may then elect to proceed with management strategy evaluation (MSE) using the information from conceptual modeling as a basis

## Conclusions



---
## Footnote: Improvements to reproducibility and provenance

* Reporting the information is not enough
* Managers appreciate the concise format, but back-end critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing
* Streamlined workflow allowed scientists to meet management deadlines
  
![soe-data-flow](EDAB_images/soe-data-flow.png)  

???
This workflows also ensures that there's no information lost between SOE cycles. We know exactly how a data set was analyzed and handled so that the data can be updated for next year's reports.

## Standardized indicator visualization in reports

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators** and plotted in a standardized way

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context&lt;sup&gt;1-3&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

## Risk assessent indicators and ranking criteria: System productivity

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and ranks the risk of not achieving optimum yield due to changes in ecosystem productivity at the base of the food web.

Four indicators are used together to assess risk of changing ecosystem productivity: primary production, zooplankton abundance, fish condition and fish recruitment. 

.table[

| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trends in ecosystem productivity |
| Low-Moderate | Trend in ecosystem productivity (1-2 measures, increase or decrease) |
| Moderate-High | Trend in ecosystem productivity (3+ measures, increase or decrease) |
| High | Decreasing trend in ecosystem productivity, all measures |
]
???
We examine trends in total primary production, zooplankton abundance for a key Mid-Atlantic species, and two aggregate fish productivity measures: condition factor (weight divided by length of individual fish) and a survey based "recruitment" (small fish to large fish) index.
