## Risks to Spatial Management: Coastwide *Edit this--presented last year*

Future considerations

*   Distribution shifts caused by changes in thermal habitat are likely to continue as long as long-term temperature trends persist. 
*   Near-term oceanographic forecasts are currently in development and may inform how future warming impacts species distributions.
*   Increased oceanographic variability needs to be captured by regional ocean models and linked to species distribution processes to better understand potential future distributions. Species with high mobility or short lifespans react differently from immobile or long lived species.

Adapting management to changing stock distributions and dynamic ocean processes will require continued monitoring of populations in space and evaluating management measures against a range of possible future spatial distributions. 

*   [East Coast Climate Scenario Planning](https://www.mafmc.org/climate-change-scenario-planning) can help coordinate management.
*   [Near term predictions of distribution shifts](https://www.lenfestocean.org/nb/news-and-publications/multimedia/crafting-models-to-predict-near-term-fisheries-shifts-under-climate-change) project in progress

## Risks to Quota Setting/Rebuilding *Edit this--presented last year*

Future considerations
*   There is a real risk that short-term predictions in assessments and rebuilding plans that assume unchanging underlying conditions will not be as effective, given the observed change documented in the prior sections in both ecological and environmental processes. 
*   Assumptions for species’ growth, reproduction, and natural mortality should continue to be evaluated for individual species. 
*   With observations of system-wide productivity shifts of multiple managed stocks, more research is needed to determine whether regime shifts or ecosystem reorganization are occurring, and how this should be incorporated into management.

## Risks: Offshore Wind Development: Implications

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="20250121_SOErisks_Gaichas_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="504" /&gt;


Implications:
*  Current plans for buildout of offshore wind in a patchwork of areas spreads the impacts differentially throughout the region 
*  Planned wind areas overlap with one of the only known right whale foraging habitats, and altered local oceanography could affect right whale prey availability. Development also brings increased vessel strike risk and the potential impacts of pile driving noise.
]

.pull-right[]

???
* Despite some changes in the timeline, offshore wind developement is still ramping up and 2030 goals are expected to be met
  + Delays in some projects may mean that the development timeline is faster in coming years
* The staggered development in space and time means that impacts will affect regions differently and at different times
* Beyond fishery revenue some of the other major impacts include:
  + Protected species interactions, particularly NARW calf migration corridors as whale hotspots overlap with lease areas. This is particularly concerning for southern NE, especially during construction
  + The effects on federal surveys through operations, survey design, habitat modification, and navigation. There's an ongoing effort to better quantify and mitigate these impacts.
