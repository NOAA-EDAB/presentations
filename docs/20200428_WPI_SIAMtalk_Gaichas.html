## What kinds of models are there?

![ecomods](EDAB_images/ecomods.png)

## Components of assessment

Prerequisite: research
* Biology and ecology of the resource and its habitat
* Improving observations and sampling
* Improving modeling and estimation methods
    
Mathematical modeling
* Population or ecosystem dynamics (numbers and or biomass) 
* Observation models: fishery catch and survey sampling  
.bluetext[    
* Adding species interactions, climate and habitat effects
]
    
Parameter estimation
* Most often maximum likelihood, Bayesian increasingly common  
.bluetext[ 
* Search algorithms needed for high dimensional space
* Genetic algorithms, others in testing
]
    
Forecasting (1-3 years out)
* Predictions depend on modeled and unmodeled processes
* Characterize uncertainty

![ternherringmod](EDAB_images/ternherringmodel.png)
]

Although there were no clear significant relationships of common tern productivity and the proportion of herring in diets across all colonies, there were some correlations between herring total biomass and tern productivity. 

Hence, the relationship on the right was developed to relate herring biomass to common tern productivity.

## Predator results summary
&lt;img src="EDAB_images/herrtopreds_results.png" width="1833" /&gt;

Three control rule types--Constant catch, conditional constant catch, and 15% restriction on change--were rejected at the second stakeholder meeting for poor fishery and predator performance.
---
## What control rules give us 90% of everything we want?

- Tern productivity at 1.0 or above more than 90% of the time
- Herring biomass more than 90% of SSBmsy
- Fishery yield more than 90% of MSY
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
- AND fishery closures (F=0) less than 1% of the time (second plot).

## What have we learned? Data-backed models allow us to test options
.pull-left-30[
Complex food web, generalist predators
- Herring is one of several important prey
- Assessing multiple prey together will likely show stronger effects on predator productivity
]
.pull-right-70[
![NEUSfw](EDAB_images/LinkNEUSfoodweb.png)

- Tern/Tuna/Groundfish/Mammal productivity is also affected by predators, weather, and other factors not modeled here
- Even relatively weak relationships still showed which herring control rules were poor
- Managers did select a harvest control rule considering a wide range of factors!

## Insights for fishery management

- Differences in food web structure between two adjacent ecosystems with similar biological communities and fishery management
  - Which species respond to the same perturbation
  - Level of uncertainty / predictability in response
  
- EBS: Influential group at mid trophic levels
  - Wasp waist transmits signal to other groups (neither AK system)
  - Self regulating dominant group (beer belly) absorbs signals
  - Beer belly systems are more predictable, stable as long as the beer belly maintains itself?

- GOA: Influential groups at high trophic levels
  - Magnifies bottom up signals and top down?
  - A less predictable system?
  - Subject to more radical change?
