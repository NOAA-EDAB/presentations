# There is no I in EAFM:
## Adapting Integrated Ecosystem Assessment <br /> for Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management

## An integrated ecosystem assessment success story (in progress)

Diverse stakeholders agreed that an ecosystem approach was necessary. Developing and implementing an ecosystem approach to fishery management was done in collaboration between managers, stakeholders, and scientists.

## Fishery management in the US

Eight regional Fishery Management Councils establish plans for sustainable management of stocks within their jurisdictions. All are governed by the same law, but tailor management to their regional stakeholder needs.

## Why an ecosystem approach?

*"We rebuilt all the stocks, so why is everyone still pissed off?" --Rich Seagraves*

in 2011, the Council asked:

.pull-left[
![visioning1](EDAB_images/MA_Visioning1.png)
]
.pull-right[
![visioning2](EDAB_images/MA_Visioning2.png)
]

And many people answered, from commercial fishery, recreational fishery, environmental organization, and interested public perspectives.

Visioning report: 

http://www.mafmc.org/s/MAFMC-stakeholder-input-report-p7b9.pdf

---
## Common themes among all stakeholder groups:

&gt;• There is a lack of confidence in the data that drive fishery management decisions.
&gt;
&gt;• Stakeholders are not as involved in the Council process as they can and should be.
&gt;
&gt;• Different jurisdictions and regulations among the many fishery management organizations result in complexity and inconsistency.
&gt;
&gt;• There is a need for increased transparency and communications in fisheries management.
&gt;
&gt;• The dynamics of the ecosystem and food web should be considered to a greater extent in fisheries management decisions.
&gt;
&gt;• Stakeholders are not adequately represented on the Council.
&gt;
&gt;• Pollution is negatively affecting the health of fish stocks.

## Why risk assessment?

Common framework across industry, science, business; but methods matter. Assessing the risks correctly is essential to good decision making.

## Mid-Atlantic Council risk assessment framework

Clarify exactly what we are assessing and why 

  * *What are we measuring?* &amp;rarr; **Risk Element** 
  * *Why are we measuring it?* &amp;rarr; **Risk Definition**
  * *How are we measuring it?* &amp;rarr; **Indicator**
  * *What is the risk?* &amp;rarr; **Risk Ranking Criteria**
  
Iterative process starting with the Council workshops

  * Council staff and scientists create examples based on Council input
  
  &amp;uarr; &amp;darr; &amp;uarr; &amp;darr; &amp;uarr; &amp;darr; &amp;uarr; &amp;darr; &amp;uarr; &amp;darr; &amp;uarr; &amp;darr; ...
                                                      
  * Council discusses, clarifies, revises with public input

## &lt;center&gt;But where will the risk assessment indicators come from?&lt;/center&gt;

---

## Meanwhile, scientists were improving ecosystem reports:

*"So what?" --John Boreman, September 2016*

1. Clear linkage of ecosystem indicators with management objectives

1. Synthesis across indicators for big picture

1. Objectives related to human-well being placed first in report

1. Short (&lt; 30 pages), non-technical (but rigorous) text

1. Emphasis on reproducibility 

&lt;img src="EDAB_images/nes-components-abstracted.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

In 2016, we began taking steps to address these common critiques of the ESR model

## Standardized indicator visualization in reports

Status (short-term) and trend (long-term) of components are measured as **indicators** and plotted in a standardized way

Indicators are selected to

1. Be broadly informative about a component in a management context&lt;sup&gt;1-3&lt;/sup&gt;

1. Minimize redundancy of information

1. Be responsive to ecosystem change

## Risk assessent indicators and ranking criteria: System productivity

This element is applied at the ecosystem level, and ranks the risk of not achieving optimum yield due to changes in ecosystem productivity at the base of the food web.

Four indicators are used together to assess risk of changing ecosystem productivity: primary production, zooplankton abundance, fish condition and fish recruitment. 

.table[

| Risk Level         | Definition                                                          |  
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low  | No trends in ecosystem productivity |
| Low-Moderate | Trend in ecosystem productivity (1-2 measures, increase or decrease) |
| Moderate-High | Trend in ecosystem productivity (3+ measures, increase or decrease) |
| High | Decreasing trend in ecosystem productivity, all measures |
]
???
We examine trends in total primary production, zooplankton abundance for a key Mid-Atlantic species, and two aggregate fish productivity measures: condition factor (weight divided by length of individual fish) and a survey based "recruitment" (small fish to large fish) index.

## Risk assessent indicators and ranking criteria: Climate 

This element is applied at the species level. Risks to species productivity (and therefore to achieving optimum yield) due to projected climate change in the Northeast US were evaluated in a comprehensive assessment&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

* Based on risk assessment, the Council selected summer flounder as high-risk fishery for conceptual modeling

&lt;img src="EDAB_images/Framework.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.pull-right[
* Working group of habitat, biology, stock assessment, management, economic and social scientists developed:

  * draft conceptual models of high risk elements, linkages
  * dataset identification and gap analysis for each element and link
  * draft questions that the Council could persue with additional work
]  
* Final conceptual model and supporting information at December 2019 Council meeting

* Council to proceed with management strategy evaluation (MSE) using the information from conceptual modeling as a basis. Topic: addressing fishery discards with EAFM

## Conclusions

Integrated ecosystem assessment is a valuable framework for the general implementation of ecosystem approaches to natural resource management

* The Council’s rapid progress in implementing EAFM resulted from positive collaboration between managers, stakeholders, and scientists. Collaboration is essential to IEA and to the success of EAFM.

* Ecosystem indicators and reporting can be tailored to specific regional objectives.

* Risk assessment is a rapid, familiar, scaleable, and transparent method to move forward with EAFM within a real-world operational fishery management context.

* This EAFM process highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting Council-derived management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors.

* Conceptual modeling links the key factors for high risk fisheries and scopes more detailed integrated analysis and management strategy evaluation.

???
The Council foresees refining the process so that ecosystem indicators monitor risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives, which can then be mitigated through management action.

## Footnote: Improvements to reproducibility and provenance

* Reporting the information is not enough
* Managers appreciate the concise format, but back-end critical for describing collection, analyses, and processing
* Streamlined workflow allowed scientists to meet management deadlines
  
![soe-data-flow](EDAB_images/soe-data-flow.png)  

???
This workflows also ensures that there's no information lost between SOE cycles. We know exactly how a data set was analyzed and handled so that the data can be updated for next year's reports.
