# US Policy defines EBFM as:

## A systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals.

Our ESP process was developed from the AFSC process, but we adjusted things slightly because of how our benchmarks are scheduled and because we are providing scientific advice to multiple Councils. 

The ESP framework is an iterative cycle that complements the stock assessment cycle. First I will give you an overview of the ESP cycle, and then I will explain each step in more detail. The ESP begins with the development of the problem statement by identifying the topics that the assessment working group and ESP team want to assess. This process includes a literature review or other method of gathering existing information on the stock, such as reviewing prior assessments and research recommendations. Next, a conceptual model is created that links important processes and pressures to stock performance. From these linkages, we develop indicators that can be used to monitor the system conditions. Next, the indicators are analyzed to determine their status and the likely impacts on the stock. Some indicators may be tested for inclusion in assessment models. Finally, all of these analyses are synthesized into a report card to provide general recommendations for fishery management.

**5. Informed by ecosystem factors or comparisons with other species**  

a. Stock-relevant ecosystem factors directly included in the assessment model, e.g.,:  
  + Environmentally dependent growth or other population processes;
  + Factors limiting/enhancing stock productivity (habitat quality, etc.);
  + Predation, disease, or episodic environmental mortality (e.g., red tide);
  
b. Ecosystem factors outside the stock assessment affecting short term prediction  
  + General measures of ecosystem productivity and habitat stability (e.g., primary production amount and timing, temperature trends, etc.);
  + Comparisons among related species; e.g., recruitment, growth, condition patterns across Mid Atlantic fish species stable, varying synchronously, or varying unpredictably;
  + Climate vulnerability or other risk assessment evaluation of potential for changing productivity under changing conditions.

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; One or more synoptic surveys over stock area for multiple years. High quality monitoring of landings size and age composition. Long term, precise monitoring of discards. Landings estimates highly accurate. &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Low precision synoptic surveys or one or more regional surveys which lack coherency in trend. Age and/or length data available with uncertain quality. Lacking or imprecise discard estimates. Moderate accuracy of landings estimates &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; No reliable abundance indices. Catch estimates are unreliable. No age and/or length data available or highly uncertain. Natural mortality rates are unknown or suspected to be highly variable. Incomplete or highly uncertain landings estimates &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Ecosystem factors accounted &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Assessment considered habitat and ecosystem effects on stock productivity, distribution, mortality and quantitatively included appropriate factors reducing uncertainty in short term predictions. Evidence outside the assessment suggests that ecosystem productivity and habitat quality are stable. Comparable species in the region have synchronous production characteristics and stable short-term predictions. Climate vulnerability analysis suggests low risk of change in productivity due to changing climate. &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Assessment considered habitat/ecosystem factors but did not demonstrate either reduced or inflated short-term prediction uncertainty based on these factors. Evidence outside the assessment suggests that ecosystem productivity and habitat quality are variable, with mixed productivity and uncertainty signals among comparable species in the region. Climate vulnerability analysis suggests moderate risk of change in productivity from changing climate. &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Assessment either
demonstrated that including appropriate ecosystem/habitat factors increases short-term prediction uncertainty, or did not consider habitat and ecosystem factors. Evidence outside the assessment suggests that ecosystem productivity and habitat quality are variable and degrading. Comparable species in the region have high uncertainty in short term predictions. Climate vulnerability analysis suggests high risk of changing productivity from changing climate. &lt;/td&gt;

## SSC Ecosystem working group analyses in progress

* Using explicit ecosystem drivers in OFL CV decision
    - For selected stocks representing a range of life history types
        - Which ecosystem factors affect uncertainty in current stock biomass and Fmsy?
        - Conceptual model mapping ecosystem factors to stock processes
        - Which current ecosystem indicators best match relevant ecosystem factors?
        - Simulation analysis: do changes in those indicators predictably change uncertainty?
* *Starting with existing summer flounder MSE framework, focusing on recruitment drivers*
* *Evaluating both benefits of correct decision and costs of incorrect decision*

        - Setting reference points? 
        - Developing rebuilding plans?
        - Other analyses requiring short-term projections?
* *More direct SSC involvement in ecosystem reporting priorities MAFMC EAFM*
* *Evaluate current multispecies indicators for common signals*
* *Evaluate proposed ecosystem-level reference points and thresholds for regional ecosystems*

## Integrated Ecosystem Assessment and the MAFMC Ecosystem Approach

Diverse stakeholders agreed that an ecosystem approach was necessary. Developing and implementing EAFM is done in collaboration between managers, stakeholders, and scientists.

The Council’s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).

Declining commercial and recreational landings can be driven by many interacting factors, including combinations of ecosystem and stock production, management actions, market conditions, and environmental change. While we cannot evaluate all possible drivers at present, here we evaluate the extent to which ecosystem overfishing (total landings exceeding ecosystem productive capacity), stock status, and system biomass trends may play a role.

## Where can environmental change come in? National standard 1

&gt;(v) Specifying MSY. (A) ... MSY ... should be re-estimated as required by changes in long-term environmental or ecological conditions, fishery technological characteristics, or new scientific information.  
...  
(C) The MSY for a stock or stock complex is influenced by its interactions with other stocks in its ecosystem and these interactions may shift as multiple stocks in an ecosystem are fished. Ecological and environmental information should be taken into account, to the extent practicable, when assessing stocks and specifying MSY. Ecological and environmental information that is not directly accounted for in the specification of MSY can be among the ecological factors considered when setting OY below MSY.

&gt;(iii) Relationship of Status Determination Criteria (SDC) to environmental and habitat change. 
...  
(A) If environmental changes cause a stock or stock complex to fall below its MSST without affecting its long-term reproductive potential, fishing mortality must be constrained sufficiently to allow rebuilding within an acceptable time frame .... SDC should not be respecified.  

&gt;(B) If environmental, ecosystem, or habitat changes affect the long-term reproductive potential of the stock or stock complex, one or more components of the SDC must be respecified. Once SDC have been respecified, fishing mortality may or may not have to be reduced, depending on the status of the stock or stock complex with respect to the new criteria.
