## Goal: include climate and ecosystem information in management decision processes

.pull-left[
*Overview*
- What types of decisions are made?

    * Single species catch limits
    * Allocations to fleets or areas
    * Coordination across boundaries and sectors 
    * Multispecies and ecosystem level tradeoffs

- How can ecosystem information support these decisions? 

    * Key tools: ecosystem reporting, risk assessment, managment strategy evaluation
    * Developing decision processes along with products

## Background: Federal fishery management in the US

Eight regional Fishery Management Councils establish plans for sustainable management of stocks within their jurisdictions. All are governed by the same law, but tailor management to their regional stakeholder needs.

## Lesson: Synthesize

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management with *synthesis themes*

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to **regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

The Gulf Stream is trending north. Ocean summer is lasting longer. In contrast to SST, long term bottom temperature is increasing in all seasons. Few surface and no bottom extreme warming events in 2022.

???
Seasonal sea surface temperatures in 2022 were above average for most of the year,  however late spring storms caused deep mixing, which delayed stratification and surface warming in late spring and early summer. A combination of long-term ocean warming and extreme events should be used to assess total heat stress on marine organisms

]
???
`r Cite(myBib,"gaichas_framework_2016")` The Councilâ€™s EAFM framework has similarities to the IEA loop. It uses risk assessment as a first step to prioritize combinations of managed species, fleets, and ecosystem interactions for consideration. Second, a conceptual model is developed identifying key environmental, ecological, social, economic, and management linkages for a high-priority fishery. Third, quantitative modeling addressing Council-specified questions and based on interactions identified in the conceptual model is applied to evaluate alternative management strategies that best balance management objectives. As strategies are implemented, outcomes are monitored and the process is adjusted, and/or another priority identified in risk assessment can be addressed.

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).

*  Highest priority requests in progress
    -  System level thresholds and reference points
    -  Trend analysis, inflections and break points
    -  Regime shifts
*  Identified some gaps
    - Short term forecasts
    - Management complexity
    - Recreational bycatch
*  Stock level indicators best addressed in assessment?

The Bluefish Research Track ESP was presented December 7 2022, and was well received by CIE reviewers. Reviewers commented that it was the most complete treatment of a stock assessment "ecosystem ToR" they had seen, and formed a good basis for integrating further ecosystem information into the stock assessment in the future. The full ESP document is available as a working paper from the [stock assessment data portal](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/saw/sasi_files.php?year=2022&species_id=32&stock_id=6&review_type_id=5&info_type_id=5&map_type_id=&filename=WP%2001%20Tyrell%20etAl%202022%20-%20ESP.pdf). 

In addition to the conceptual model, a summary table was developed for bluefish ecosystem indicators. This type of summary could contribute to OFL CV decisions with further information on how these indicator levels affect uncertainty in assessment.

.pull-left-40[
*Management decisions*
1.  What are our issues and goals?
1.  Current decisions  
    +  Stock assessments
    +  Advice on catch levels
    +  Harvest control rules
1.  New (current) decisions  
    +  Habitat change or restoration
    +  Changing species distribution and interactions
    +  Tradeoffs between fisheries
    +  Tradeoffs between ocean use sectors

]

.pull-right-60[
*Methods and tools*
1.  Stakeholder engagement, surveys, strategic planning  
1.  Add information to current process  
    +  Ecosystem ToRs, overviews, SOE
    +  Risk or uncertainty assessments
    +  Management strategy evaluation
1.  Integrate across current processes  
    +  Risk assessment
    +  Conceptual models
    +  Scenario planning
    +  MSE (again)
