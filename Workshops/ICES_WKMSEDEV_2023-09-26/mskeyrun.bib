	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

	abstract = {We explored alternative status determination criteria and reference points that could simplify fisheries management using a simulated multispecies/ecosystem-based operational management procedure. There are four components to the procedure: (i) limit total removals from the ecosystem; (ii) allocate the total removals limit among aggregate species groups; (iii) maintain individual species above minimum stock size thresholds; and (iv) optimize the species mix (within aggregates) based on bio-economic portfolio analysis. In this procedure, “overfishing” criteria are applied only to aggregates of species at the ecosystem and group level, but “overfished” criteria apply at the species/stock level. Previous work using multispecies production models identified conditions where conservation and yield objectives could be balanced: aggregations of species with similar life histories, species interactions, and responses to environmental forcing supported the highest yields while minimizing risks that individual stocks dropped below biomass thresholds. Here, we use a more complex length structured multispecies, multifleet simulation model to explore management procedure steps (i)–(iii). Different species aggregation rules were applied (single species, functional groups, and full system), and yield curves were constructed for each aggregation level by sequentially increasing effort in each of the fleets (alone and simultaneously), while recruitment for each species varied stochastically around a function based on spawning stock biomass. The performance of individual species and each aggregate type was then compared with respect to yield, biomass, and economic revenue objectives under changing environmental conditions. Our results evaluate the trade-offs between these objectives for the 10 species in the simulated system. Overall we found that there are aggregate catch limits that can both maximize yield and revenue while conserving biomass. However, community composition and revenue trade-off over a range of fishing effort. We consider this a starting point for further development with scientists, managers, fishermen, and other stakeholders in the region.},

Even for fisheries with excellent data collection programs, scientific surveys and sophisticated assessments, the estimates of catch levels that will maintain healthy fisheries or rebuild depleted ones are often far from accurate. Consequently recommended catch levels often fluctuate more than necessary in response to error in assessments rather than true stock variability and frequently react too slowly due to lags in data collection, assessment and implementation. Overly optimistic estimates of stock size and future growth have often led to allowing catch levels that undermine rebuilding. Fishery management strategies also rarely include specific objectives developed with stakeholder involvement which can undermine stakeholders‘ support for conservation even when it may be in their best interest.},

A stakeholder driven management  strategy evaluation (MSE) was conducted that incorporated a broad range  of objectives. The MSE process was completed within one year. Constant  catch, conditional constant catch, and a biomass-based (BB) HCR with a  15\% restriction on the interannual change in the quota could achieve  more stable yields than BB HCRs without such restrictions, but could not  attain as high of yields and resulted in more negative outcomes for  terns (a herring predator). A similar range of performance could be  achieved by applying a BB HCR annually, every three years, or every five  years. Predators (i.e., dogfish, tuna, and terns) were generally  insensitive to the range of HCRs. While median net revenues were  sensitive to some HCRs, most HCRs produced a stable equilibrium of net revenue. In order to meet  management needs, some aspects of the simulations were less than might  be considered scientifically ideal, but using models of intermediate  complexity formed a foundation for future improvements.},

Conducting an open MSE aligns well with publicly-driven management but requires clear goals and communication. Investment in effective organizers, impartial facilitators, and knowledgeable analysts can improve communication and understanding of MSE, to the betterment of fisheries management. We aim to further MSE best practices on integrating stakeholders and hope that our lessons learned on communication, engagement, and integration of MSE into an existing management arena will be useful to other practitioners.},

	abstract = {Having a realistic representation of ecosystems in fisheries models is important in the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). While different modelling approaches support EBFM, accounting for trophic interactions and uncertainty in stock dynamics is important for management advice. Multispecies models exist, but are rarely used for assessments. Most stock assessments are single species models and predation is subsumed into natural mortality, which is often an assumed known value. The use of state-space assessment models, which account for stochasticity in unobserved processes (process errors), is increasing. However, many stocks are managed assuming deterministic processes. Little is known of how ignoring predation and process errors in stock assessment can impact the perception of the stocks and therefore fisheries management. We developed an age-structured multispecies operating model that simulated data with errors in observations, recruitment and fish abundance. Four estimation models (EMs) that differed according to whether or not they accounted for predation or process errors were fitted to the simulated data. Relative differences between true and predicted outputs were estimated as a measure of bias. Equilibrium unfished biomass was estimated for each model as a proxy reference point. Ignoring predation had the largest impact on stock perception and resulted in large bias in parameters, derived outputs and absolute or relative reference points. Estimating unobserved processes was not sufficient in limiting the bias when natural mortality was misspecified. Ignoring process errors had limited bias but the bias increased when no contrasts existed in fishing mortality over time. Looking solely at likelihood values to choose among models is misleading and predictive ability could be used to prevent selecting models that overfit the data. Synthesis and applications. Ignoring trophic interactions that occur in marine ecosystems induces bias in stock assessment outputs and results in low model predictive ability with subsequently biased reference points. While it may be difficult to estimate natural mortality when no data exist to inform it, stock managers should remember that, if predation is large, assuming a constant mortality over time and/or age could have large consequences on stock perception and reference point estimates and affect resulting management advice.},

In 2006, the US Congress required the implementation of annual catch limits (ACLs) and accountability measures by 2010 to prevent overﬁshing, and by 2011 to recover overﬁshed stocks. These requirements were modelled on the existing management system for Northeast Paciﬁc groundﬁsh, where more than 20 ﬁsh stocks and assemblages have been managed sustainably for 30 years. Science-based overﬁshing levels and acceptable biological catches (ABCs) have been implemented for each stock or assemblage, with buffers between the two to avoid overﬁshing. Total allowable catches are set at or below the acceptable biological catch. Suballocations of quotas by season, area, and gear type, along with in-season ﬁshery closures based on extensive observer coverage and vessel monitoring, ensure that quotas are not exceeded. To comply with ACL requirements, the North Paciﬁc Fishery Management Council has deﬁned ABC as an ACL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACLs for successful management of Northeast Paciﬁc groundﬁsh, suggesting that their use in other US ﬁsheries might reduce the risk of overﬁshing and enhance the recovery of overﬁshed stocks.},

Overarching principles are that ﬁshing mortality rates should not jeopardize the capacity of a stock to produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and that overﬁshed stocks (i.e. biomass is too low) should be rebuilt to the level that will support MSY. The science-based system for achieving sustainable ﬁsheries is implemented, in part, through setting annual catch limits (ACLs) that cannot exceed the acceptable biological catch that is recommended by Scientiﬁc and Statistical Committees using methods that account for scientiﬁc uncertainty. Accountability measures (AMs) are management measures to prevent ACLs from being exceeded or correct any overages that occur. Implementation in 2012 of ACLs and AMs in all Federal ﬁsheries was a historical achievement in the United States; one that will help rebuild stocks and ensure sustainable ﬁsheries into the future. Some remaining challenges include: determining appropriate catch levels and management approaches for stocks with incomplete data; assessing more stocks, more frequently; addressing differences between managing stocks as a complex vs. managing individual stocks in a multistock ﬁshery; and incorporating social and economic factors in determining the appropriate response to uncertainty.},

Under high-baseline carbon emission scenarios (RCP 8.5), end-of-century (2075–2100) pollock and Pacific cod fisheries collapse in {\textgreater}70\% and {\textgreater}35\% of all simulations, respectively. Our analysis suggests that 2.1–2.3 °C (modeled summer bottom temperature) is a tipping point of rapid decline in gadid biomass and catch. Multiyear stanzas above 2.1 °C become commonplace in projections from {\textasciitilde}2030 onward, with higher agreement under RCP 8.5 than simulations with moderate carbon mitigation (i.e., RCP 4.5). We find that EBFM ameliorates climate change impacts on fisheries in the near-term, but long-term EBFM benefits are limited by the magnitude of anticipated change.},

	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) provides a simulation framework to test the performance of living marine resource management. MSE has now been adopted broadly for use in single-species fishery management, often using a relatively simple “operating model” that projects population dynamics of one species forward in time. However, many challenges in ecosystem-based management involve tradeoffs between multiple species and interactions of multiple stressors. Here we use complex operating models, multi-species ecosystem models of the California Current and Nordic and Barents Seas, to test threshold harvest control rules that explicitly address the linkage between predators and prey, and between the forage needs of predators and fisheries. Specifically, within Atlantis ecosystem models we focus on how forage (zooplankton) availability affects the performance of harvest rules for target fish, and how these harvest rules for fish can account for environmentally-driven fluctuations in zooplankton. Our investigation led to three main results. First, consistent with studies based on single-species operating models, we found that compared to constant F = FMSY policies, threshold rules led to higher target stock biomass for Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) in the California Current and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Nordic and Barents Seas. Performance in terms of catch of these species varied depending partly on the biomass and recovery trajectory for the simulated stock. Secondly, the multi-species operating models and the harvest control rules that linked fishing mortality rates to prey biomass (zooplankton) led to increased catch variability; this stemmed directly from the harvest rule that frequently adjusted Pacific hake or mackerel fishing rates in response to zooplankton, which are quite variable in these two ecosystems. Thirdly, tests suggested that threshold rules that increased fishing when productivity (zooplankton) declined had the potential for strong ecosystem effects on other species. These effects were most apparent in the Nordic and Barents Seas simulations. The tests of harvest control rules here do not include uncertainty in monitoring of fish and zooplankton, nor do they include uncertainty in stock assessment and implementation; these would be required for full MSE. Additionally, we intentionally chose target fish with strong mechanistic links to particular zooplankton groups, with the simplifying assumption that zooplankton biomass followed a forced time series. Further developing and testing of ecosystem-level considerations can be achieved with end-to-end ecosystem models, such as the Atlantis models applied here, which have the added benefit of tracking the follow-on effects of the harvest control rule on the broader ecosystem.},

The authors apply BMA to probabilistic visibility forecasting using a predictive PDF that is a mixture of discrete point mass and beta distribution components. Three approaches to developing predictive PDFs for visibility are developed, each using BMA to postprocess an ensemble of visibility forecasts. In the ﬁrst approach, the ensemble is generated by a translation algorithm that converts predicted concentrations of hydrometeorological variables into visibility. The second approach augments the raw ensemble visibility forecasts with model forecasts of relative humidity and quantitative precipitation. In the third approach, the ensemble members are generated from relative humidity and precipitation alone. These methods are applied to 12-h ensemble forecasts from 2007 to 2008 and are tested against verifying observations recorded at Automated Surface Observing Stations in the Paciﬁc Northwest. Each of the three methods produces predictive PDFs that are calibrated and sharp with respect to both climatology and the raw ensemble.},

This paper proposes a statistical method for postprocessing ensembles based on Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which is a standard method for combining predictive distributions from different sources. The BMA predictive probability density function (PDF) of any quantity of interest is a weighted average of PDFs centered on the individual bias-corrected forecasts, where the weights are equal to posterior probabilities of the models generating the forecasts and reflect the models’ relative contributions to predictive skill over the training period. The BMA weights can be used to assess the usefulness of ensemble members, and this can be used as a basis for selecting ensemble members; this can be useful given the cost of running large ensembles. The BMA PDF can be represented as an unweighted ensemble of any desired size, by simulating from the BMA predictive distribution.},

These methods allow the data-based selection of a “best” model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

This includes a combination of multiple forecast model results that does not dwell on the ensemble mean but uses a unique collective bias reduction procedure. A theoretical framework for this procedure is provided, utilizing a suite of models that is constructed from the well-known Lorenz low-order nonlinear system. A tutorial that includes a walk-through table and illustrates the inner workings of the multimodel superensemble’s principle is provided. Systematic errors in a single deterministic model arise from a host of features that range from the model’s initial state (data assimilation), resolution, representation of physics, dynamics, and ocean processes, local aspects of orography, water bodies, and details of the land surface. Models, in their diversity of representation of such features, end up leaving unique signatures of systematic errors. The multimodel superensemble utilizes as many as 10 million weights to take into account the bias errors arising from these diverse features of multimodels. The design of a single deterministic forecast models that utilizes multiple features from the use of the large volume of weights is provided here. This has led to a better understanding of the error growths and the collective bias reductions for several of the physical parameterizations within diverse models, such as cumulus convection, planetary boundary layer physics, and radiative transfer. A number of examples for weather, seasonal climate, hurricanes and sub surface oceanic forecast skills of member models, the ensemble mean, and the superensemble are provided.},

This analytical framework allowed to integrate multiple sources of information, including fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent data, collected at different scales and aggregation levels. The model includes the two main fisheries targeting hake in the area, the trawl and the gillnet fisheries, and account for differences in their selectivity and effort. Alternative models were used for testing different assumptions on recruitment and growth. The model is then used to predict the main trajectory of the stock during the next years and to evaluate the potential effects of implementing closed areas management scenarios in the hake nurseries as a specific tool to reduce fishing mortality on recruits. The modelling framework presented performed successfully also in a commercial landing data limited context, common for the Mediterranean. Our results provide statistical support for fast growth and multiple recruitment events assumptions. Including both these key features represent an unprecedented improvement of modelling hake population dynamics in the Mediterranean. We found that the reduction in the fishing effort that characterized the fisheries in the study area during the last few years, coupled with fast recovery abilities of the hake stock, has the potentiality to allow a moderate increase of the stock during the next years. Interestingly, our simulations show that the positive effects which might be expected from protecting hake nursery grounds are only marginally related to a reduction in hake recruits fishing mortality. Although our model relies on assumptions and surely represents an over-simplification of the real world, it still contributed to improve our understanding of the temporal dynamics of one of the most valuable fish stocks in the central Mediterranean.},

Gadget is a powerful and flexible framework that has been developed to model complicated statistical marine ecosystems within a fisheries management and biological context, and can take many features of the ecosystem into account. Gadget allows the user to include a number of features of the ecosystem into the model: One or more species, each of which may be split into multiple components; multiple areas with migration between areas; predation between and within species; growth; mat-uration; reproduction and recruitment; multiple commercial and survey fleets taking catches from the populations. Gadget works by running an internal forward projection model based on many parameters describing the ecosystem, and then comparing the output from this model to observed measurements to get a likelihood score. The model ecosystem parameters can then be adjusted, and the model rerun , until an optimum is found, which corresponds to the model with the lowest likelihood score. This iterative, computationally intensive process is handled within Gadget , using a robust minimisation algorithm. Gadget has successfully been used to investigate the population dynamics of stock complexes in Ice-landic waters, the Barents Sea, the North Sea, the Irish and Celtic Seas and the Sofala Bank fishery of Mozambique.

	abstract = {Gadget is a statistical modelling framework that can be used to assess individual fish stocks and to create multispecies, multi-fleet and multi-area models. The development of a complex multispecies model requires understanding of the modelled single-species population. Simple single-species models are essential in evaluating whether more complex models increase understanding of the population dynamics. In this paper, Gadget is illustrated using a single-species case study with two stock components on one area. Features of the implementation include immature and mature stock components, a maturation process, along with commercial and survey fleets. Parameter estimation is done using maximum likelihood based on a variety of datasets. The estimated parameters relate to growth, maturation, fleet selection, recruitment and the initial population. The data types used to calculate the likelihood include survey indices and biological samples from the commercial catch and surveys. Optimisation of the model, along with a protocol to estimate appropriate weighting of the likelihood components, is described. A range of different assumptions and estimation methods are evaluated including the effect of reduced data availability on parameter estimation by excluding age data from the likelihood components.},

Understanding the relationship between predator and prey size in the individual predator’s food selection process is a cornerstone of ecological modelling. Stomach content data are used to inform such models, as they provide prey species specific information about the predator diet in the wild. These data are strongly relevant as direct observations of species trophic interactions, but they have limitations, and are costly. Our objective was to develop and test a model which is able to predict changes in the Baltic cod diet by reconstructing the dynamics of cod and its prey, herring and sprat, populations, their length distributions, and parametrizing trophic interactions between them. We analysed time-series of cod stomach data and built an age-length structured multispecies model using Gadget. Both observed and predicted diets of smaller (juvenile) cod consisted mainly of benthos, while larger cod fed mostly on fishes (herring and sprat). Our model could predict the main patterns in species and length composition of cod diet. We also identified important knowledge gaps, especially on benthos dynamics and processes affecting prey availability and predator preference.},

Analyses based on observations collected from the southern North Sea in 1988–89 are compared to analyses based on an equivalent dataset extracted from the output of the POLCOMS-ERSEM model. A combination of PCA and nonparametric multivariate approaches is used to demonstrate that in broad terms the model performs well, simulating patterns in, and interrelationships between, a range of variables. Errors are greatest in late winter and early spring, and are associated with inaccurate estimation of the magnitude of primary production in coastal waters and the amount of suspended particulate matter in the water column.},

Hence summary diagrams, such as the Taylor diagram [Taylor, 2001, Journal of Geophysical Research, 106, D7, 7183–7192], may meet this requirement by exploiting mathematical relationships between widely known statistical quantities in order to succinctly display a suite of model skill metrics in a single plot. In this paper, sensitivity results from a coupled model are compared with Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite ocean color data in order to assess the utility of the Taylor diagram and to develop a set of alternatives. Summary diagrams are only effective as skill assessment tools insofar as the statistical quantities they communicate adequately capture differentiable aspects of model performance. Here we demonstrate how the linear correlation coefficients and variance comparisons (pattern statistics) that constitute a Taylor diagram may fail to identify other potentially important aspects of coupled model performance, even if these quantities appear close to their ideal values. An additional skill assessment tool, the target diagram, is developed in order to provide summary information about how the pattern statistics and the bias (difference of mean values) each contribute to the magnitude of the total Root-Mean-Square Difference (RMSD). In addition, a potential inconsistency in the use of RMSD statistics as skill metrics for overall model and observation agreement is identified: underestimates of the observed field's variance are rewarded when the linear correlation scores are less than unity. An alternative skill score and skill score-based summary diagram is presented.},

In such applications it is imperative that a rigorous model skill assessment is conducted so that the model's capabilities are tested and understood. Herein, we review several metrics and approaches useful to evaluate model skill. The definition of skill and the determination of the skill level necessary for a given application is context specific and no single metric is likely to reveal all aspects of model skill. Thus, we recommend the use of several metrics, in concert, to provide a more thorough appraisal. The routine application and presentation of rigorous skill assessment metrics will also serve the broader interests of the modeling community, ultimately resulting in improved forecasting abilities as well as helping us recognize our limitations.},

	abstract = {Assessing the validity of a model is essential for its credibility especially when the model is used as decision making tool. Complex dynamic fishery models are recommended to investigate the functioning of fisheries and to assess the impact of management strategies, particularly spatial fishing regulations. However, their use is limited due to the difficulty and computational cost of parameterizing and gaining confidence, particularly for parameter rich models. These difficulties are compounded by uncertainty regarding parameter values, many of which are often taken from literature or estimated indirectly. Here we propose a methodology to improve confidence and understanding in the model, easily transferable to any complex model. The approach combines sensitivity analysis, scalability of parameters, optimization procedures, and model skill assessment in order to parameterize, validate and achieve the most plausible formulation of a model given the available knowledge while reducing the computational load. The methodology relies on five steps: (1) sensitivity analysis, (2) classification of parameters into a hierarchy according to their sensitivity and the nature of their uncertainty, (3) building of alternative formulations, (4) calibration and (5) skill evaluation. The approach is illustrated here by reviewing the parameterization of the ISIS-Fish model of the anchovy fishery in the Bay of Biscay. By using this approach, it is possible to make a thorough assessment of lacking information (e.g. accessibility to fishing and adult mortality) and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the model in the context of different hypotheses. When applied to the ISIS-Fish model, the results suggest higher egg and adult mortality than formerly estimated, as well as new estimates for the migration towards spawning areas. They show the reliability of the model in terms of correlations with observations and the need for further efforts to model purse seiner catches. The methodology proved to be a cost-efficient tool for objectively assessing applied model validity in cases where parameter values are a mix of literature, expert opinion and calibration.},

	abstract = {The move toward an ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires new operational tools in order to support management decisions. Among them, ecosystem- and fisheries-based models are critical to quantitatively predict the consequences of future scenarios by integrating available knowledge about the ecosystem across different scales. Despite increasing development of these complex system models in the last decades, their operational use is still currently limited in Europe. Many guidelines are already available to help the development of complex system models for advice yet they are often ignored. We identified three main impediments to the use of complex system models for decision support: (1) their very complexity which is a source of uncertainty; (2) their lack of credibility, (3) and the challenge of communicating/transferring complex results to decision makers not accustomed to deal with multivariate uncertain results. In this paper, we illustrate these somehow theoretical “best practices” with tangible successful examples, which can help the transfer of complex system models from academic science to operational advice. We first focus on handling uncertainty by optimizing model complexity with regards to management objectives and technical issues. We then list up methods, such as transparent documentation and performance evaluation, to increase confidence in complex system models. Finally, we review how and where complex system models could fit within existing institutional and legal settings of the current European fisheries decision framework. We highlight where changes are required to allow for the operational use of complex system models. All methods and approaches proposed are illustrated with successful examples from fisheries science or other disciplines. This paper demonstrates that all relevant ingredients are readily available to make complex system models operational for advice.},

Reporting ENA indicators with uncertainty boundaries lets end-users draw stronger inferences and can increase confidence in model results. However, few studies developing these indicators have estimated uncertainty due to data limitations and computational challenges. In this study, we used Linear Inverse Modelling with an Ecopath model of the Irish Sea to investigate how the incorporation of uncertainty in dietary data can strengthen inferences based on model-derived ENA indicators. A Monte Carlo approach was used to generate ten thousand data-bound parameterisations for the Irish Sea food web and provide plausible distribution estimates for functional group diets. ENA results captured the plausible range of state-indicators and provided robust estimates of the control exerted by components within the food web. Results suggest that, higher trophic components, such as mammals, birds, and elasmobranchs in the Irish Sea are controlled by mid-to-low trophic components, such as small pelagic fish, invertebrates, and plankton. Fisheries discards also played an important role in the flow of energy to groups such as Nephrops (Norway lobster), crabs and lobsters, and seabirds. These results bolster our understanding of food web dynamics in the Irish Sea and demonstrate how information derived from ENA indicators can have implications for effective and sustainable ecosystem based management. Finally, the methods established here represent an important step in the maturation of marine ecosystem modelling and ENA for management purposes.},

	abstract = {Ecological network analysis (ENA) provides numerous ecosystem level indices offering a valuable approach to compare and categorize the ecological structure and function of ecosystems. The inclusion of ENA methods in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) has insured their continued contribution to ecosystem-based management. In EwE, ENA-derived ecological conclusions are currently based on single values of ENA indices calculated from a unique input flow matrix. Here, we document an easy-to-use routine that allows EwE users to incorporate uncertainty in EwE input data into the calculation of ENA indices. This routine, named ENAtool, is a suite of Matlab functions that performs three main steps: (1) import of an existing Ecopath model and its associated parameter uncertainty values in the form of uncertainty intervals into Matlab; (2) generation of an ensemble of Ecopath models with the same structure as the original, and with parameter values varying based on the prescribed uncertainty limits; and (3) calculation of a set of 13 ENA indices for each ensemble member (one set of flow values) and of summary statistics across the whole ensemble. This novel routine offers the opportunity to calculate ENA indices ranges and confidence intervals, and thus to perform quantitative data analyses. An application of ENAtool on a pre-existing Ecopath model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf is presented, with a focus on the robustness of previously published ENA-based ecological traits of this ecosystem when the newly introduced uncertainty values are added. We also describe the sensitivity of the ENAtool results to both the number of ensemble members used and to the uncertainty interval set around each input parameter. Ecological conclusions derived from EwE, particularly those regarding the comparison of structural and functional elements for a range of ecosystem types or the assessment of ecosystem properties along gradients of environmental conditions or anthropogenic disturbances, will gain in statistical interpretability.},

The modeling community is however still finding the effective representation of microbial processes as challenging and lacks of techniques for assessing flow uncertainty explicitly. A linear inverse model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf was built using a Monte Carlo method coupled with a Markov Chain (LIM-MCMC) to characterize the system’s trophic food-web status and its associated structural and functional properties. By taking into account the natural variability of ecosystems (and their associated flows) and the lack of data on these environments, this innovative approach enabled the quantification of uncertainties for both estimated flows and derived food-web indices. This uncertainty assessment constituted a real improvement on the existing Ecopath model for the same area and both models results were compared. Our results suggested a food web characterized by main flows at the basis of the food web and a high contribution of primary producers and detritus to the entire system input flows. The developmental stage of the ecosystem was characterized using estimated Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indices; the LIM-MCMC produced a higher estimate of flow specialization (than the estimate from Ecopath) owing to better consideration of bacterial processes. The results also pointed to a detritus-based food-web with a web-like structure and an intermediate level of internal flow complexity, confirming the results of previous studies.

	abstract = {The widespread use of ecological network models (e.g., Ecopath, Econetwrk, and related energy budget models) has been laudable for several reasons, chief of which is providing an easy-to-use set of modeling tools that can present an ecosystem context for improved understanding and management of living marine resources (LMR). Yet the ease-of-use of these models has led to two challenges. First, the veritable explosion of the use and application of these network models has resulted in recognition that the content and use of such models has spanned a range of quality. Second, as these models and their application have become more widespread, they are increasingly being used in a LMR management context. Thus review panels and other evaluators of these models would benefit from a set of rigorous and standard criteria from which the basis for all network models and related applications for any given system (i.e., the initial, static energy budget) can be evaluated. To this end, as one suggestion for improving network models in general, here I propose a series of pre-balance (PREBAL) diagnostics. These PREBAL diagnostics can be done, now, in simple spreadsheets before any balancing or tuning is executed. Examples of these PREBAL diagnostics include biomasses, biomass ratios, vital rates, vital rate ratios, total production, and total removals (and slopes thereof) across the taxa and trophic levels in any given energy budget. I assert that there are some general ecological and fishery principles that can be used in conjunction with PREBAL diagnostics to identify issues of model structure and data quality before balancing and dynamic applications are executed. I humbly present this PREBAL information as a simple yet general approach that could be easily implemented, could be considered for further incorporation into these model packages, and as such would ultimately result in a straightforward way to evaluate (and perhaps identify areas for improving) initial conditions in food web modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering–Chukchi–Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

	abstract = {We explored alternative status determination criteria and reference points that could simplify fisheries management using a simulated multispecies/ecosystem-based operational management procedure. There are four components to the procedure: (i) limit total removals from the ecosystem; (ii) allocate the total removals limit among aggregate species groups; (iii) maintain individual species above minimum stock size thresholds; and (iv) optimize the species mix (within aggregates) based on bio-economic portfolio analysis. In this procedure, “overfishing” criteria are applied only to aggregates of species at the ecosystem and group level, but “overfished” criteria apply at the species/stock level. Previous work using multispecies production models identified conditions where conservation and yield objectives could be balanced: aggregations of species with similar life histories, species interactions, and responses to environmental forcing supported the highest yields while minimizing risks that individual stocks dropped below biomass thresholds. Here, we use a more complex length structured multispecies, multifleet simulation model to explore management procedure steps (i)–(iii). Different species aggregation rules were applied (single species, functional groups, and full system), and yield curves were constructed for each aggregation level by sequentially increasing effort in each of the fleets (alone and simultaneously), while recruitment for each species varied stochastically around a function based on spawning stock biomass. The performance of individual species and each aggregate type was then compared with respect to yield, biomass, and economic revenue objectives under changing environmental conditions. Our results evaluate the trade-offs between these objectives for the 10 species in the simulated system. Overall we found that there are aggregate catch limits that can both maximize yield and revenue while conserving biomass. However, community composition and revenue trade-off over a range of fishing effort. We consider this a starting point for further development with scientists, managers, fishermen, and other stakeholders in the region.},

Even for fisheries with excellent data collection programs, scientific surveys and sophisticated assessments, the estimates of catch levels that will maintain healthy fisheries or rebuild depleted ones are often far from accurate. Consequently recommended catch levels often fluctuate more than necessary in response to error in assessments rather than true stock variability and frequently react too slowly due to lags in data collection, assessment and implementation. Overly optimistic estimates of stock size and future growth have often led to allowing catch levels that undermine rebuilding. Fishery management strategies also rarely include specific objectives developed with stakeholder involvement which can undermine stakeholders‘ support for conservation even when it may be in their best interest.},

Constant  catch, conditional constant catch, and a biomass-based (BB) HCR with a  15\% restriction on the interannual change in the quota could achieve  more stable yields than BB HCRs without such restrictions, but could not  attain as high of yields and resulted in more negative outcomes for  terns (a herring predator). A similar range of performance could be  achieved by applying a BB HCR annually, every three years, or every five  years. Predators (i.e., dogfish, tuna, and terns) were generally  insensitive to the range of HCRs. While median net revenues were  sensitive to some HCRs, most HCRs produced a stable equilibrium of net revenue. In order to meet  management needs, some aspects of the simulations were less than might  be considered scientifically ideal, but using models of intermediate  complexity formed a foundation for future improvements.},

	abstract = {Having a realistic representation of ecosystems in fisheries models is important in the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). While different modelling approaches support EBFM, accounting for trophic interactions and uncertainty in stock dynamics is important for management advice. Multispecies models exist, but are rarely used for assessments. Most stock assessments are single species models and predation is subsumed into natural mortality, which is often an assumed known value. The use of state-space assessment models, which account for stochasticity in unobserved processes (process errors), is increasing. However, many stocks are managed assuming deterministic processes. Little is known of how ignoring predation and process errors in stock assessment can impact the perception of the stocks and therefore fisheries management. We developed an age-structured multispecies operating model that simulated data with errors in observations, recruitment and fish abundance. Four estimation models (EMs) that differed according to whether or not they accounted for predation or process errors were fitted to the simulated data. Relative differences between true and predicted outputs were estimated as a measure of bias. Equilibrium unfished biomass was estimated for each model as a proxy reference point. Ignoring predation had the largest impact on stock perception and resulted in large bias in parameters, derived outputs and absolute or relative reference points. Estimating unobserved processes was not sufficient in limiting the bias when natural mortality was misspecified. Ignoring process errors had limited bias but the bias increased when no contrasts existed in fishing mortality over time. Looking solely at likelihood values to choose among models is misleading and predictive ability could be used to prevent selecting models that overfit the data. Synthesis and applications. Ignoring trophic interactions that occur in marine ecosystems induces bias in stock assessment outputs and results in low model predictive ability with subsequently biased reference points. While it may be difficult to estimate natural mortality when no data exist to inform it, stock managers should remember that, if predation is large, assuming a constant mortality over time and/or age could have large consequences on stock perception and reference point estimates and affect resulting management advice.},

These requirements were modelled on the existing management system for Northeast Paciﬁc groundﬁsh, where more than 20 ﬁsh stocks and assemblages have been managed sustainably for 30 years. Science-based overﬁshing levels and acceptable biological catches (ABCs) have been implemented for each stock or assemblage, with buffers between the two to avoid overﬁshing. Total allowable catches are set at or below the acceptable biological catch. Suballocations of quotas by season, area, and gear type, along with in-season ﬁshery closures based on extensive observer coverage and vessel monitoring, ensure that quotas are not exceeded. To comply with ACL requirements, the North Paciﬁc Fishery Management Council has deﬁned ABC as an ACL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACLs for successful management of Northeast Paciﬁc groundﬁsh, suggesting that their use in other US ﬁsheries might reduce the risk of overﬁshing and enhance the recovery of overﬁshed stocks.},

	abstract = {Fisheries management in the United States is primarily governed by the Magnuson – Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, ﬁrst enacted in 1976. Overarching principles are that ﬁshing mortality rates should not jeopardize the capacity of a stock to produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and that overﬁshed stocks (i.e. biomass is too low) should be rebuilt to the level that will support MSY. The science-based system for achieving sustainable ﬁsheries is implemented, in part, through setting annual catch limits (ACLs) that cannot exceed the acceptable biological catch that is recommended by Scientiﬁc and Statistical Committees using methods that account for scientiﬁc uncertainty. Accountability measures (AMs) are management measures to prevent ACLs from being exceeded or correct any overages that occur. Implementation in 2012 of ACLs and AMs in all Federal ﬁsheries was a historical achievement in the United States; one that will help rebuild stocks and ensure sustainable ﬁsheries into the future. Some remaining challenges include: determining appropriate catch levels and management approaches for stocks with incomplete data; assessing more stocks, more frequently; addressing differences between managing stocks as a complex vs. managing individual stocks in a multistock ﬁshery; and incorporating social and economic factors in determining the appropriate response to uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Although frequently suggested as a goal for ecosystem-based fisheries management, incorporating ecosystem information into fisheries stock assessments has proven challenging. The uncertainty of input data, coupled with the structural uncertainty of complex multi-species models, currently makes the use of absolute values from such models contentious for short-term single-species fisheries management advice. Here, we propose a different approach where the standard assessment methodologies can be enhanced using ecosystem model derived information. Using a case study of the Irish Sea, we illustrate how stock-specific ecosystem indicators can be used to set an ecosystem-based fishing mortality reference point (FECO) within the “Pretty Good Yield” ranges for fishing mortality which form the present precautionary approach adopted in Europe by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). We propose that this new target, FECO, can be used to scale fishing mortality down when the ecosystem conditions for the stock are poor and vice versa. This approach provides a streamlined quantitative way of incorporating ecosystem information into catch advice and provides an opportunity to operationalise ecosystem models and empirical indicators, while retaining the integrity of current assessment models and the FMSY-based advice process.},

	abstract = {Worldwide fisheries management has been undergoing a paradigm shift from a single-species approach to ecosystem approaches. In the U.S., NOAA has adopted a policy statement and Road Map to guide the development and implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). NOAA’s EBFM policy supports addressing the ecosystem interconnections to help maintain resilient and productive ecosystems, even as they respond to climate, habitat, ecological, and social and economic changes. Managing natural marine resources while taking into account their interactions with their environment and our human interactions with our resources and environment requires the support of ecosystem science, modeling, and analysis. Implementing EBFM will require using existing mandates and approaches that fit regional management structures and cultures. The primary mandate for managing marine fisheries in the U.S. is the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Many tenets of the Act align well with the EBFM policy; however, incorporating ecosystem analysis and models into fisheries management processes has faced procedural challenges in many jurisdictions. In this paper, we review example cases where scientists have had success in using ecosystem analysis and modeling to inform management priorities, and identify practices that help bring new ecosystem science information into existing policy processes.},

	abstract = {During the past half-century notable changes have occurred in the Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). To understand how the system functions as a whole, to evaluate the potential responses of this ecosystem to numerous human-induced perturbations, and to elucidate the relative magnitude of key biota and processes, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center instituted the Energy Modeling and Analysis eXercise (EMAX). The primary goal of EMAX was to establish an ecological network model (i.e., a more nuanced energy budget) of the entire Northeast U.S. food web. The EMAX work focused on the interdisciplinary development of a network model which reflected contemporary conditions (1996–2000) in four major regions of the ecosystem:, Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, Southern New England and Middle Atlantic Bight. The model had 36 network “nodes” or biomass state variables across a broad range of the biological hierarchy within each trophic level and incorporated a wide range of key rate processes. Because this ecosystem has been relatively well studied many of the biomass estimates were based on field measurements and biomass estimates from the scientific literature were required only for a relatively small number of nodes. The emphasis of EMAX was to explore the particular role of small pelagic fishes in the ecosystem. Our results show that small pelagic fishes are indeed keystone species in the ecosystem. We examined a suite of novel ecosystem metrics as we compared the four regions and provided a general, system-level description of the NEUS ecosystem. The general patterns of the network properties in the four regions were similar; however the network indices and metrics did reveal some noteworthy differences among regions reflecting their different oceanographic and faunal characteristics. The process of compiling and evaluating available data required by an ecosystem network model identified important gaps in our understanding which should be addressed during future ecosystem surveys. Moreover, exercises like EMAX will be a valuable starting point as we continue to progress towards ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM).},

	abstract = {Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) is an effective tool to gauge the relative performance of fishery management options. For the most part, MSEs have been applied to single-species management procedures. However, to be more inclusive of all the biological and technical interactions occurring within a system, ecosystem-based strategies are emerging. In order to test the feasibility of these strategies, a full ecosystem model should be used as an operating model. Mass balance food web models include many features that managers are interested in and therefore can be useful as an operating model. Until recently, full feedback interactions between a management strategy and a mass balance operating model were impractical. However, with the development of Rpath, users now have the ability to fully customize their mass balance models. We developed new functionality for the Rpath modelling framework that allows it to be used as a flexible operating model. Using an example Georges Bank model, we demonstrate how Rpath can now pause the simulation, evaluate an external model, and use the results to modify the parameters of the operating model. This new flexibility will allow users to test a variety of management strategies or couple to other models making Rpath a valuable tool for conducting MSEs.},

Continued development and testing of analytical tools that are expected to address EBFM needs are essential for guiding the management of fisheries resources in achieving and balancing multiple social, economic, and conservation objectives. To address these needs, we present and compare alternative climate-informed multi-species statistical catch-at-age models to account for spatio-temporal differences in stock distributions, with application to four groundfish species (walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Gulf of Alaska, USA. We integrate across multiple forms of uncertainty regarding the data and distribution of Pacific halibut using an ensemble modelling approach. Models developed here can be used to supplement current tactical fisheries management and inform on the trade-offs between harvesting across groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska. This approach may be applicable for other situations where spatial and temporal overlap is extensive among closely coupled species.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of record low winter sea-ice coverage and warming water temperatures in the eastern Bering Sea have signaled the potential impacts of climate change on this ecosystem, which have implications for commercial fisheries production. We investigate the impacts of forecasted climate change on the eastern Bering Sea food web through the end of the century under medium- and high-emissions climate scenarios in combination with a selection of fisheries management strategies by conducting simulations using a dynamic food web model. The outputs from three global earth system models run under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios were dynamically downscaled using a regional ocean and biogeochemical model to project ecosystem dynamics at the base of the food web. Four fishing scenarios were explored: status quo, no fishing, and two scenarios that alternatively assume increased fishing emphasis on either gadids or flatfishes. Annual fishery quotas were dynamically simulated by combining harvest control rules based on model-simulated stock biomass, while incorporating social and economic tradeoffs induced by the Bering Sea’s combined groundfish harvest cap. There was little predicted difference between the status quo and no fishing scenario for most managed groundfish species biomasses at the end of the century, regardless of emission scenario. Under the status quo fishing scenario, biomass projections for most species and functional groups across trophic levels showed a slow but steady decline toward the end of the century, and most groups were near or below recent historical (1991–2017) biomass levels by 2080. The bottom–up effects of declines in biomass at lower trophic levels as forecasted by the climate-enhanced lower trophic level modeling, drove the biomass trends at higher trophic levels. By 2080, the biomass projections for species and trophic guilds showed very little difference between emission scenarios. Our method for climate-enhanced food web projections can support fisheries managers by informing strategic guidance on the long-term impacts of ecosystem productivity shifts driven by climate change on commercial species and the food web, and how those impacts may interact with different fisheries management scenarios.},

	abstract = {The northeast United States Atlantis model (NEUSv2) is an end-to-end ecosystem model that can simulate biogeochemical, ecological, fishery, management, and socio-economic processes within marine ecosystems. As a major update to the original model, NEUSv2 includes changes to the model's functional group definitions and forcing data. NEUSv2 is the first Atlantis model to use a satellite-ocean-color-derived phytoplankton size class model that was tuned specifically for the region to force marine primary production. Additionally, physical ocean variables (currents, temperature, and salinity) were updated using a high-resolution global ocean reanalysis. Despite its coarse resolution, NEUSv2 was capable of reproducing the broad spatial patterns seen in the physical and biological forcing sources, with the exception of some circulation features. NEUSv2 produced plausible zooplankton and planktivore biomass, a stable lower trophic food web, and recent trends in zooplankton biomass. NEUSv2 meets calibration criteria for the persistence and long-term stability of functional group biomass. Given the success of this new Atlantis forcing approach, we detail the observations and challenges regarding spatial scale-related processes, data assimilation, and biological calibration. We also discuss possible tradeoffs with model scope, calibration, and the availability of feedback mechanisms. This NEUSv2 hindcast is well suited for exploring ecosystem-level sensitivity to lower trophic processes and for testing alternative biogeochemical forcing. Further developments will improve model performance for higher trophic levels.},
