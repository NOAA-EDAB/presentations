# Multispecies and Ecosystem Operating Models

## Overview

Combining existing tools to evaluate EBFM procedures: Link multispecies model to MSE framework with built in single species assessment tools for New England prototype EBFM MSE (pMSE)

Fundamental objectives:
*  Maintain or increase inflation adjusted total value for the fishery
*  Preserve ecosystem function and structure
*  Maintain stock complex biomass around levels that optimize fishing opportunities 
*  Prevent overfishing
*  Response of regulations to stocks at low abundance, and recovery of depleted stocks
*  Reduce regulatory complexity

Example explanatory materials, including Rshiny for exploring results

p.s. Food web model Rpath MSE capabilities

p.p.s. Atlantis potential

Hydra: multispecies operating model conditioned on Georges Bank data within MSE framework as prototype test of EBFM strategies. 

Results: additional flexibility and increased yield possible with EBFM "ceilings and floors" without increased risk to single stocks.

## Herring MSE food web model results: ecosystem uncertainty?

.pull-left-30[
Compare 10% change (green, same as previous slide gray boxes) with more extreme "herring" biomass:  
* 50% increase from base herring biomass (red)
* 50% decrease from base herring biomass (blue)

More system uncertainty with increased herring biomass?
