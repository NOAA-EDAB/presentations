# How does it work?

- Uses the `knitr` package to embed R or other computer language in to markdown
  - Markdown is plain text that can be read by both humans and computers
- Pandoc then converts the markdown into the output format of your choice
- Output can be Word, PDF, html
- Some features work better than others depending on what output you choose
