# State of the Ecosystem reports
## Improving ecosystem information and synthesis for fishery managers

- Ecosystem indicators linked to management objectives `r Cite(myBib, "depiper_operationalizing_2017")`
    + Contextual information
    + Report evolving since 2016
    + Fishery-relevant subset of full Ecosystem Status Reports

- Open science emphasis `r Cite(myBib, "bastille_improving_2021")`

- Used within Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council's Ecosystem Process `r Cite(myBib, "muffley_there_2021")`
    + Risk assessment `r Cite(myBib,"gaichas_implementing_2018")`
    + Conceptual modeling `r Cite(myBib,"depiper_learning_2021")`
    + Management strategy evaluation ([MSE](https://www.mafmc.org/actions/summer-flounder-mse))

## Regime shifts in State of the Ecosystem reports: Ecosystem synthesis themes

Characterizing ecosystem change for fishery management

* Societal, biological, physical and chemical factors comprise the **multiple system drivers** that influence marine ecosystems through a variety of different pathways. 
* Changes in the multiple drivers can lead to <span style="background-color:yellow;">**regime shifts** â€” large, abrupt and persistent changes in the structure and function of an ecosystem.</span>  
* Regime shifts and changes in how the multiple system drivers interact can result in **ecosystem reorganization** as species and humans respond and adapt to the new environment.

# Key points
]


<font size="+3">1. We have not developed standard methods to identify ecosystem level regime shifts<font>

<font size="+3">2. Managers request that we clearly define "large" "abrupt" and "persistent" (and while we are at it, change in structure/function)<font>

<font size="+2">Hoping this workshop does both.<font>
