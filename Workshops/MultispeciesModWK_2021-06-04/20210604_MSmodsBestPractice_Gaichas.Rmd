## Problem identification &harr; Appropriateness of model for problem

Define the problem, and why this model is (or reviewers to explain why it is not) appropriate. 

Define the focal species, spatial, and temporal resolution needed to address the problem. 

Example problem:

Changing natural mortality resulting from predation is desired input for in single species assessments

ICES WGSAM is asked to provide M-at-age time series for North Sea and Baltic herring, cod, whiting, haddock, sprat, sandeel, and possibly other species. Spatial scale is at the stock level and temporal resolution is annual, starting at a stock-specific year and going to 2018. 

Therefore, the multispecies model(s) must provide this output and sensitivity in this particular output is most important. However, there are other potential uses for these models that have yet to be defined.

## Problem identification &harr; Appropriateness of model for problem

A new use for WKIRISH:

>The aim with the Irish Sea Ecopath is to use the model to “fine tune” the quota advice within the predefined EU Fmsy ranges. In “good” conditions you could fish at the top of the range, in “poor” conditions you should fish lower in the range. The range has already been evaluated as giving good yield while still being precautionary, so this should be fine for ICES to use in advice, so any reviewers should have this in mind.

For the Irish Sea EwE model, key outputs will be used to determine where the reference point should be within the MSY range for each species. Therefore, outputs defining Ecosystem conditions and both ecosystem and species productivity under the prevailing conditions are most important.

## Problem identification &harr; Appropriateness of model for problem

ms-keyrun project objectives

EBFM Objective 1: what happens with all the species in the region under a certain management regime?
* Model needs to minimally
    - Include all the species in the region
    - Implement the alternative management regimes
* Define "what happens"
    - Increase/decrease relative to base?
    - Status relative to reference points? (model needs to estimate reference points)
    - Details on distribution, demographics needed? 

EBFM Objective 2: how well do multispecies models perform for assessment?  
* Which models are better at what (size/age structured and biomass dynamics)
* What data are necessary?
* Which species actually need to be included? Use Rpath to id
* Need a fleet based model? Add econ?
The above includes fits to historical data for all the models

Overall goal: tools vetted and ready to go with any of further questions from the Council

This is an important paper both because it demonstrates the importance of addressing strong species interactions, and it shows that measures of fit do not indicate good model predictive performance. Ignoring process error caused bias, but much smaller than ignoring species interactions.

## Multispecies catch at age estimation model: *seeking catchy name* [FIT: MSCAA](https://nmfs-ecosystem-tools.github.io/MSCAA/)

Species interactions: 
- Predation: Top down only (predators increase M of prey, predators grow regardless of prey)

*Based on standard age structured stock assessment population dynamics equations*
- First, split $M$ for species $i$ age $a$ into components: $$M_{i,a,t} = M1_i + M2_{i,a,t}$$  
- Calculate $M2$ with MSVPA predation equation, which applies a predator consumption:biomass ratio to the suitable prey biomass for that predator. 
- Suitability is a function of predator size preference (based on an age-specific predator:prey weight ratio) and prey vulnerability (everything about the prey that isn't size related). 
- Also sensitive to "other food"

$$M2_{i,a,t} = \frac{1}{N_{i,a,t}W_{i,a,t}}\sum_j \sum_b CB_{j,b} B_{j,b,t} \frac{\phi_{i,a,j,b,t}}{\phi_{j,b,t}}$$
???

Size preference is $$g_{i,a,j,b,t}=\exp\bigg[\frac{-1}{2\sigma_{i,j}^2}\bigg(\ln\frac{W_{j,b,t}}{W_{i,a,t}}-\eta_{i,j}\bigg)^2\bigg]$$

Suitability, $\nu$ of prey $i$ to predator $j$:
$$\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}=\rho_{i,j}g_{i,a,j,b,t}$$

Scaled suitability: 
$$\tilde\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}=\frac{\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}}{\sum_i \sum_a \nu_{i,a,j,b,t} + \nu_{other}}$$

Suitable biomass of prey $i$ to predator $j$:
$$\phi_{i,a,j,b,t}=\tilde\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}B_{i,a,t}$$

Available biomass of other food, where $B_other$ is system biomass minus modeled species biomass:
$$\phi_{other}=\tilde\nu_{other}B_{other,t}$$
Total available prey biomass:
$$\phi_{j,b,t}=\phi_{other} + \sum_i \sum_a \phi_{i,a,j,b,t}$$

## Multispecies catch at length simulation model: [Hydra](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/hydra_sim)

Species interactions: 
- Predation: Top down only (predators increase M of prey, predators grow regardless of prey)  

*Same MSVPA predation equation as MSCAA (but length based), same dependencies and caveats*

- Suitability, $\rho$, of prey species $m$ size $n$ for a given predator species $i$ size $j$ a function of size preference and vulnerability  {0,1}. 
- Food intake $I$ for each predator-at-size is temperature dependent consumption rate times mean stomach content weight. 

$$M2_{m,n,t} = \sum_i \sum_j I_{i,j,t} N_{i,j,t} \frac{\rho_{i,j,m,n}}{\sum_a \sum_b \rho_{i,j,a,b} W_{a,b} N_{a,b} + \Omega}$$

But:
- Covariates on growth, maturity, recruitment possible; intended for environmental variables
- So could hack in prey-dependent growth but making it dynamic is difficult

We specify 'preferred' predator-prey weight ratio (log scale) $\Psi_j$ and variance in predator size preference $\sigma_j$ to compare with the actual predator-prey weight ratio $(w_n / w_j)$ to get the size preference $\vartheta$. 

$$\vartheta_{n,j} = \frac{1}{(w_n / w_j)\sigma_j \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{[log_e(w_n / w_j) - \Psi_j]}{2\sigma_j^2}}$$

Food intake is $$I_{i,j,t} = 24 [\delta_j e^{\omega_i T}]\bar{C}_{i,j,k,t}$$

## Multispecies production simulation: [Kraken](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/Kraken) and estimation [FIT: MSSPM](https://nmfs-ecosystem-tools.github.io/MSSPM/)

Species interactions: 
- Predation: Top down (predation decreases population growth of prey, predator population growth independent of prey)
- Competition: Within and between species groups

*Based on Shaefer and Lotka-Volterra population dynamics and predation equations*
- Species have intrinsic population growth rate $r_i$
- Full model has 
    - Carrying capacity $K$ at the species group level $K_G$ and at the full system level $K_\sigma$
    - Within group competition $\beta_{ig}$ and between group competition $\beta_{iG}$ slow population growth near $K$
    - Predation $\alpha_{ip}$ and harvest $H_i$ reduce population

$$\frac{dN_i}{dt} = r_iN_i \bigg(1 - \frac{N_i}{K_G} - \frac{\sum_g \beta_{ig}N_g}{K_G} - \frac{\sum_G \beta_{iG}N_G}{K_\sigma - K_G} \bigg) - N_i\sum_p\alpha_{ip}N_p - H_iN_i$$

- Simpler version used in most applications has interaction coefficient $\alpha$ that incorporates carrying capacity
$$B_{i,t+1}=B_{i,t} + r_iB_{i,t} - B_{i,t}\sum_j\alpha_{i,j}B_{j,t} - C_{i,t}$$
???
Interaction coefficients $\alpha_{i,j}$ can be positive or negative

$C$ can be a Catch time series, an exploitation rate time series $B_{i,t}*F_{i,t}$ or an $qE$ (catchability/Effort) time series.

Environmental covariates can be included on growth or carrying capacity (in the model forms that have an explicit carrying capacity).

Dynamic model (with MSE capability):

$$\frac{dB_i}{dt} = \left(1 - A_i - U_i \right) \sum_{j} Q \left(B_i, B_j \right) -  \sum_{j} Q \left( B_j, B_i \right) - M0_iB_i  - C_m B_i$$
Consumption: 

$$Q \left( B_i, B_j \right) = Q_{ij}^* \Bigg( \frac{V_{ij} Ypred_j}{V_{ij} - 1 + \left( 1 - S_{ij} \right) Ypred_j + S_{i} \sum_k \left( \alpha_{kj} Ypred_k \right)} \Bigg) \times \\\Bigg( \frac{D_{ij} Yprey_i^{\theta_{ij}}}{D_{ij} - 1 + \big( \left( 1 - H_{ij} \right) Yprey_i + H_{i} \sum_k \left( \beta_{ik} Yprey_k \right) \big)^{\theta_{ij}}} \Bigg)$$  
Where $V_{ij}$ is vulnerability, $D_{ij}$ is “handling time” accounting for predator saturation, and $Y$ is relative biomass which may be modified by a foraging time multiplier $Ftime$,

$$Y[pred|prey]_j =  Ftime_j \frac {B_j}{B_j^*}$$

.pull-right-30[

The parameters $S_{ij}$ and $H_{ij}$ are flags that control whether the predator density dependence $S_{ij}$ or prey density dependence $H_{ij}$ are affected solely by the biomass levels of the particular predator and prey, or whether a suite of other species’ biomasses in similar roles impact the relationship. 

For the default value for $S_{ij}$ of 0 (off), the predator density dependence is only a function of that predator biomass and likewise for prey with the default value of 0 for $H_{ij}$.  

Values greater than 0 allow for a density-dependent effects to be affected by a weighted sum across all species for predators, and for prey.  The weights $\alpha_{kj}$ and $\beta_{kj}$ are normalized such that the sum for each functional response (i.e. $\sum_k\alpha_{kj}$ and $\sum_k\beta_{kj}$ for the functional response between predator *j* and prey *i*) sum to 1.  The weights are calculated from the density-independent search rates for each predator/prey pair, which is equal to $2Q_{ij}^*V_{ij} / (V_{ij} - 1)B_i^*B_j^*$.

In general, if support for a relationship between herring and predator recruitment was evident, it was modeled as a predator recruitment multiplier based on the herring population $N_{y}$ relative to a specified threshold $N_{thresh}$:

$$\bar{R}_{y+a}^P = R_{y+a}^P  * \frac{\gamma(N_{y}/N_{thresh})}{(\gamma-1)+(N_{y}/N_{thresh})}$$ 

where $\gamma$ > 1 links herring population size relative to the threshold level to predator recruitment.

If a relationship between predator growth and herring population size was evident, annual changes in growth were modeled by modifying either the Ford-Walford intercept $\alpha_y^P$ or slope $\rho_y^P$:


$$B_{y+1}^P = S_{y}^P (\alpha_y^P N_{y}^P + Fw_{slope} B_{y}^P) + \alpha_y^PR_{y+1}^P$$
or 

$$B_{y+1}^P = S_{y}^P (Fw_{int} N_{y}^P + \rho_y^P B_{y}^P) + Fw_{int} R_{y+1}^P$$

where either $\alpha_y^P$ or $\rho_y^P$ are defined for a predator using herring population parameters.

Finally, herring population size $N_{y}$ could be related to predator survival using an annual multiplier on constant predator annual natural mortality $v$: 

$$v_{y} =  v e ^ {-(\frac{N_{y}}{N_{F=0}})\delta}$$

where 0 < $\delta$ <1 links herring population size to predator survival.
