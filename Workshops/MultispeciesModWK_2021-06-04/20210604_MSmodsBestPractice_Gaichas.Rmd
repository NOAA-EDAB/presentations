## Problem identification &harr; Appropriateness of model for problem

Define the problem, and why this model is (or reviewers to explain why it is not) appropriate. 

* What focal species, spatial, and temporal resolution are needed to address the problem?

* What processes need to be modeled to address the problem?

Example problem:

Multiple predators feed on multiple fished prey stocks within a particular ecosystem. There is a need to include predation mortality within assessments for individual prey stocks in that ecosystem. 

Model(s) must estimate predation mortality at age, and to provide M-at-age time series for North Sea and Baltic herring, cod, whiting, haddock, sprat, sandeel, and possibly other species. Spatial scale is at the stock level and temporal resolution is annual, starting at a stock-specific year and going to 2018. 

Therefore, the multispecies model(s) must provide this output and sensitivity to model assumptions in this particular output is most important.

## Problem identification &harr; Appropriateness of model for problem

A different example problem (ICES WKIRISH, `r Cite(myBib, "bentley_refining_2021")`):

.pull-left[
>The aim with the Irish Sea Ecopath is to use the model to “fine tune” the quota advice within the predefined EU Fmsy ranges. In “good” conditions you could fish at the top of the range, in “poor” conditions you should fish lower in the range. The range has already been evaluated as giving good yield while still being precautionary, so this should be fine for ICES to use in advice, so any reviewers should have this in mind.

]
]

For the Irish Sea EwE model, key outputs will be used to determine where the catch advice should be within the MSY range for each species. Therefore, outputs defining ecosystem conditions and both ecosystem and species productivity under the prevailing conditions are most important.

---
## Best Practices 2: Is the scientific basis of the model sound?

Previously used models often skip this step, reasoning that if the science was sound previously it still is.

(Discuss...)

WGSAM has provided model framework reviews for the LeMans ensemble (2016), FLBEIA (2017), and a multispecies state-space model (2017). “Constructed Model” evaluation issues and best practices apply here: 

1. Spatial and temporal resolution
1. Algorithm choices
1. Assumptions (scientific basis, computational infrastructure; adequacy of conceptual model)
1. Data availability/software tools
1. Quality assurance/quality control (code testing)
1. Test scenarios
1. Corroboration with observations
1. Uncertainty/sensitivity analysis
1. Peer review (WGSAM's role, but consider previous reviews from prior steps)

Note linkages between problem identification and scientific basis

---
## Best Practices 3: Is the input data quality and parameterization sufficient for the problem?

See above defining the problem. Which datasets are adequate, which could be improved, and which are missing?

Show the input data as a simple chart: beginning and end of time series, gaps, different length of time series, spatial resolution of data.

Give information on input data pedigree/quality, reference for where it comes from, whether it is survey data or comes from other model output, whether confidence intervals or other uncertainty measures are available and used in the model.

Categorize the assumptions behind modeled ecological or biological processes. Emphasize those related to species interactions (predation, competition), environmental pressures, and also fleet dynamics if needed to address the problem. If the model is spatial, how do these processes happen in space?

Is the parameterization consistent with scientific knowledge (e.g. (PREBAL) diagnostics `r Cite(myBib, "link_adding_2010")` for general relationships across trophic levels, sizes, etc).

---
## Best Practices 4: Does model output compare well with observations? `r Cite(myBib, "kaplan_guinea_2016")`

Characterize the reference dataset used for comparisons. Has the data been used to construct this model? Is the reference dataset from another model? Describe referece data source(s). 

1. (if important--projection) All functional groups persist in an unfished unperturbed run  
1. (if important--projection) Model stabilizes for the last ~20 years of an unfished, unperturbed 80-100 year run  
1. The keyrun should define the hindcast time period where agreement with other data sources or assessments is needed. Review will determine if the model fits adequately within that time period. Error ranges are needed for comparison or reference datasets.  
1. Focal species should match biomass and catch trends over the hindcast time period. For full system models, species comprising a majority of biomass should also match general hindcast trends. Suggested tests include modeling efficiency, RMSE, etc. `r Cite(myBib, c("sterman_appropriate_1984", "stow_skill_2009", "joliff_summary_2009", "allen_multivariate_2009", "lehuta_selection_2013", "lehuta_reconciling_2016", "olsen_ecosystem_2016"))` 
1. Patterns of temporal variability captured (emergent or forced with e.g. recruitment time series)  
1. Productivity for focal species (or groups totaling ~80% of system biomass in full system models) should qualitatively match life history expectations (prebal diagnostics)  
1. Natural mortality decreases with age for majority of groups  
1. Age and length structure qualitatively matches expectations for majority of groups  
1. Diet predicted qualitatively matches empirical diet comp for majority of groups  
1. Spatial distribution of outputs match reference datasets for spatial models (most important if output required at spatial resolution of model, comment if a match in aggregate but not at higher resolution)  
1. Ecosystem indicators (relationship between abundance and body size, pelagic to demersal, Large Fish Indicator) match reference data if needed for problem

*Ignore predation at your peril: results from multispecies state-space modeling  *  `r Cite(myBib, "trijoulet_performance_2020")`

???
This is an important paper both because it demonstrates the importance of addressing strong species interactions, and it shows that measures of fit do not indicate good model predictive performance. Ignoring process error caused bias, but much smaller than ignoring species interactions.
See also Vanessa's earlier paper evaluating diet data interactions with multispecies models

## Best Practices 5: Uncertainty

Has uncertainty been assessed in the output of interest? Has sensitivity analysis been performed and how does it affect those outputs?

The key-run should show estimates of uncertainty in the output quantity of interest. Uncertainty analysis is best if possible to estimate confidence intervals. If not possible list key sources of uncertainty, expected bounds on outputs based on those (possibly from sensitivity analysis)--i.e. design sensitivity analysis to approximate uncertainty analysis. 

Specific analyses, sensitivity of key output in:

1. Retrospective analysis (5 year peel of all input data)

1. Forecast uncertainty: remove last 3-5 years of survey index only to see how well the model works in forecast mode, given the catch that actually happened. 

1. Sensitivity to stomach data and other key or low-confidence data sources

1. Sensitivity to key parameters: consumption rates, residual mortality (M1, M0)

1. Sensitivity to initial conditions 

For complex models with long runtimes, simpler ways to address uncertainty may be appropriate `r Cite(myBib, "kaplan_guinea_2016")`.

Best practice is to retain multiple parameterizations that meet the above criteria to allow scenario testing across a range of parameterizations. Parameter uncertainty can be addressed even in complex models. A simple method uses bounding (e.g. base, low bound, and high bound productivity scenarios; `r Cite(myBib, "saltelli_how_2010")`.

---
## Best Practices 6: Previous peer review

What did they point out and have issues been addressed?

Review of constructed models should have evaluated spatial and temporal resolution, algorithm choices, data availability and software tools, quality assurance/quality control of code, and test scenarios. 

`r Cite(myBib, "bentley_refining_2021")` conclude that continuous peer review throughout a process is itself a best practice

Also that you need to be part of a management process to have the model used, see Townsend et al 2019

## Problem identification &harr; Appropriateness of model for problem

ms-keyrun project objectives

EBFM Objective 1: what happens with all the species in the region under a certain management regime?
* Model needs to minimally
    - Include all the species in the region
    - Implement the alternative management regimes
* Define "what happens"
    - Increase/decrease relative to base?
    - Status relative to reference points? (model needs to estimate reference points)
    - Details on distribution, demographics needed? 

EBFM Objective 2: how well do multispecies models perform for assessment?  
* Which models are better at what (size/age structured and biomass dynamics)
    - Define "better"
    - Define "what" key outputs are most important, what are we assessing
* What data are necessary?
* Which species actually need to be included? Use Rpath to id
* Need a fleet based model? Add econ?

The above includes fits to historical data for all the models

Overall goal: tools vetted and ready to go with any of further questions from the Council

## Multispecies catch at age estimation model: *seeking catchy name* [FIT: MSCAA](https://nmfs-ecosystem-tools.github.io/MSCAA/)

Species interactions: 
- Predation: Top down only (predators increase M of prey, predators grow regardless of prey)

*Based on standard age structured stock assessment population dynamics equations*
- First, split $M$ for species $i$ age $a$ into components: $$M_{i,a,t} = M1_i + M2_{i,a,t}$$  
- Calculate $M2$ with MSVPA predation equation, which applies a predator consumption:biomass ratio to the suitable prey biomass for that predator. 
- Suitability is a function of predator size preference (based on an age-specific predator:prey weight ratio) and prey vulnerability (everything about the prey that isn't size related). 
- Also sensitive to "other food"

$$M2_{i,a,t} = \frac{1}{N_{i,a,t}W_{i,a,t}}\sum_j \sum_b CB_{j,b} B_{j,b,t} \frac{\phi_{i,a,j,b,t}}{\phi_{j,b,t}}$$
???

Size preference is $$g_{i,a,j,b,t}=\exp\bigg[\frac{-1}{2\sigma_{i,j}^2}\bigg(\ln\frac{W_{j,b,t}}{W_{i,a,t}}-\eta_{i,j}\bigg)^2\bigg]$$

Suitability, $\nu$ of prey $i$ to predator $j$:
$$\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}=\rho_{i,j}g_{i,a,j,b,t}$$

Scaled suitability: 
$$\tilde\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}=\frac{\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}}{\sum_i \sum_a \nu_{i,a,j,b,t} + \nu_{other}}$$

Suitable biomass of prey $i$ to predator $j$:
$$\phi_{i,a,j,b,t}=\tilde\nu_{i,a,j,b,t}B_{i,a,t}$$

Available biomass of other food, where $B_other$ is system biomass minus modeled species biomass:
$$\phi_{other}=\tilde\nu_{other}B_{other,t}$$
Total available prey biomass:
$$\phi_{j,b,t}=\phi_{other} + \sum_i \sum_a \phi_{i,a,j,b,t}$$

## Multispecies catch at length simulation model: [Hydra](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/hydra_sim)

Species interactions: 
- Predation: Top down only (predators increase M of prey, predators grow regardless of prey)  

*Same MSVPA predation equation as MSCAA (but length based), same dependencies and caveats*

- Suitability, $\rho$, of prey species $m$ size $n$ for a given predator species $i$ size $j$ a function of size preference and vulnerability  {0,1}. 
- Food intake $I$ for each predator-at-size is temperature dependent consumption rate times mean stomach content weight. 

$$M2_{m,n,t} = \sum_i \sum_j I_{i,j,t} N_{i,j,t} \frac{\rho_{i,j,m,n}}{\sum_a \sum_b \rho_{i,j,a,b} W_{a,b} N_{a,b} + \Omega}$$

But:
- Covariates on growth, maturity, recruitment possible; intended for environmental variables
- So could hack in prey-dependent growth but making it dynamic is difficult

We specify 'preferred' predator-prey weight ratio (log scale) $\Psi_j$ and variance in predator size preference $\sigma_j$ to compare with the actual predator-prey weight ratio $(w_n / w_j)$ to get the size preference $\vartheta$. 

$$\vartheta_{n,j} = \frac{1}{(w_n / w_j)\sigma_j \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{[log_e(w_n / w_j) - \Psi_j]}{2\sigma_j^2}}$$

Food intake is $$I_{i,j,t} = 24 [\delta_j e^{\omega_i T}]\bar{C}_{i,j,k,t}$$

## Multispecies production simulation: [Kraken](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/Kraken) and estimation [FIT: MSSPM](https://nmfs-ecosystem-tools.github.io/MSSPM/)

Species interactions: 
- Predation: Top down (predation decreases population growth of prey, predator population growth independent of prey)
- Competition: Within and between species groups

*Based on Shaefer and Lotka-Volterra population dynamics and predation equations*
- Species have intrinsic population growth rate $r_i$
- Full model has 
    - Carrying capacity $K$ at the species group level $K_G$ and at the full system level $K_\sigma$
    - Within group competition $\beta_{ig}$ and between group competition $\beta_{iG}$ slow population growth near $K$
    - Predation $\alpha_{ip}$ and harvest $H_i$ reduce population

$$\frac{dN_i}{dt} = r_iN_i \bigg(1 - \frac{N_i}{K_G} - \frac{\sum_g \beta_{ig}N_g}{K_G} - \frac{\sum_G \beta_{iG}N_G}{K_\sigma - K_G} \bigg) - N_i\sum_p\alpha_{ip}N_p - H_iN_i$$

- Simpler version used in most applications has interaction coefficient $\alpha$ that incorporates carrying capacity
$$B_{i,t+1}=B_{i,t} + r_iB_{i,t} - B_{i,t}\sum_j\alpha_{i,j}B_{j,t} - C_{i,t}$$
???
Interaction coefficients $\alpha_{i,j}$ can be positive or negative

$C$ can be a Catch time series, an exploitation rate time series $B_{i,t}*F_{i,t}$ or an $qE$ (catchability/Effort) time series.

Environmental covariates can be included on growth or carrying capacity (in the model forms that have an explicit carrying capacity).

The parameters $S_{ij}$ and $H_{ij}$ are flags that control whether the predator density dependence $S_{ij}$ or prey density dependence $H_{ij}$ are affected solely by the biomass levels of the particular predator and prey, or whether a suite of other species’ biomasses in similar roles impact the relationship. 

For the default value for $S_{ij}$ of 0 (off), the predator density dependence is only a function of that predator biomass and likewise for prey with the default value of 0 for $H_{ij}$.  

Values greater than 0 allow for a density-dependent effects to be affected by a weighted sum across all species for predators, and for prey.  The weights $\alpha_{kj}$ and $\beta_{kj}$ are normalized such that the sum for each functional response (i.e. $\sum_k\alpha_{kj}$ and $\sum_k\beta_{kj}$ for the functional response between predator *j* and prey *i*) sum to 1.  The weights are calculated from the density-independent search rates for each predator/prey pair, which is equal to $2Q_{ij}^*V_{ij} / (V_{ij} - 1)B_i^*B_j^*$.

In general, if support for a relationship between herring and predator recruitment was evident, it was modeled as a predator recruitment multiplier based on the herring population $N_{y}$ relative to a specified threshold $N_{thresh}$:

$$\bar{R}_{y+a}^P = R_{y+a}^P  * \frac{\gamma(N_{y}/N_{thresh})}{(\gamma-1)+(N_{y}/N_{thresh})}$$ 

where $\gamma$ > 1 links herring population size relative to the threshold level to predator recruitment.

If a relationship between predator growth and herring population size was evident, annual changes in growth were modeled by modifying either the Ford-Walford intercept $\alpha_y^P$ or slope $\rho_y^P$:


$$B_{y+1}^P = S_{y}^P (\alpha_y^P N_{y}^P + Fw_{slope} B_{y}^P) + \alpha_y^PR_{y+1}^P$$
or 

$$B_{y+1}^P = S_{y}^P (Fw_{int} N_{y}^P + \rho_y^P B_{y}^P) + Fw_{int} R_{y+1}^P$$

where either $\alpha_y^P$ or $\rho_y^P$ are defined for a predator using herring population parameters.

Finally, herring population size $N_{y}$ could be related to predator survival using an annual multiplier on constant predator annual natural mortality $v$: 

$$v_{y} =  v e ^ {-(\frac{N_{y}}{N_{F=0}})\delta}$$

where 0 < $\delta$ <1 links herring population size to predator survival.
