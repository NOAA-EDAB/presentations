# Today's workshop

* Version control systems + Git

* Concepts in Git

* Integration with Github

* Create, collaborate, and share

## Your friendly neighborhood Version Control System 1:

.pull-left[
* Local Version Control (L-VC): 

  * Developed in response to error-prone manual VC

  * A database keeping track of file changes ("patches")
  
  * Patches can be added and subtracted to revert to documents in a certain state
]

.pull-right[

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/sean.hardison/Documents/git/presentations/Workshops/Getting Git 2019-04-11/EDAB_images/LVCS.png")
```

]

---

## Your friendly neighborhood Version Control System 2:

.pull-left[
* Centralized Version Control (CVC): 

  * Allows collaboration between systems

  * Files can be **checked out** from central server hosting database of file patches
  
  * Centralized server is weakness: If server goes down, VC/collaboration cannot occur 
]

.pull-right[

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/sean.hardison/Documents/git/presentations/Workshops/Getting Git 2019-04-11/EDAB_images/DVCS.png")
```

]

---

## Your friendly neighborhood Version Control System 3:

.pull-left[
* Distributed Version Control (DVC): 

  * Users **check out** copies of full directories rather than individual files

    * These directories, or **repositories**, include the full history of each file
  
  * In short: everyone has the database of patches 

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir,"DVCS.png"))
```


]

## Distributed Version Control Systems

* Distributed Version Control (DVC):

  * A copy you create of a remote repository is called a **clone**

.center[
![clone-wars](EDAB_images/clone-wars.gif)
]

* **Git** is a distributed version control software

---

.box-highlight[

**Vocabulary check**

* Repository: A file directory that is being tracked by **Git**
  
  * Also called a "repo"
  
* Clone: An exact copy of a repository containing the full history of project changes

]

---
## How does Git work?

* Git stores information about the state of all files in the repository (think repo "**snapshots**")

```{r snapshots, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir,"git-snapshots.png"))
```

* Files that have not been changed are not replicated, but linked to

* All information is **local**, and all operations can be performed offline

???
When a snapshot is taken, a file is assigned an id specific to the checksum, or hash. No further changes can be made to that file without Git first knowing about it, and so you cannot lose information.

---

## The Three File States

* Files can be in one of three states after being added to repo

    1. Staged - Files are marked for **committing** (the snapshot)

    2. Modified - Staged files have been modified, but not committed

    3. Committed - Snapshot taken, file states stored to local database

```{r file-states, out.width = "60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(image.dir,"file-states.png"))
```

## Actually Getting Git: User set-up

1. Open command line or terminal window

2. Check user name and email address

  .remark-inline-code[
    `git config --global user.name`
  ]
  .remark-inline-code[
    `git config --global user.email`
  ]

3. Check text editor
  .remark-inline-code[
    `git config --global core.editor`
  ]


???
Important that user name and email map to what you've used to sign up with on github

On windows, you will need to specify the full path to the executable file if changing text editor

---

## Cloning a repository

**From RStudio**

1. Open RStudio and select `File -> New Project`

2. Select `Version Control`

3. Select `Git`

4. Paste `https://github.com/seanhardison1/getting-git` into repo URL

5. Name your project `getting-git`


**From cmd/terminal**

1. Open command line or terminal

2. `cd` into a directory where you want project to be housed

3. Enter .remark-inline-code[`git clone https://github.com/seanhardison1/getting-git`]


???
RStudio will automatically assign an Rproject file to your repository. 

---

.box-highlight[

**Vocabulary check**

* Commit: Git for "file save"

* Remote: A repository not located on your local machine

    * The repository you just cloned is "the remote"
]


---
## Create, commit, and push

**In RStudio**

1. Create a new file in `/getting-git` (.R, .txt, etc)

2. Stage your file

3. Commit changes

4. Push to remote repository (Github)

![add_commit_push](EDAB_images/add_commit_push.gif)

---
## Creating your own repository

**From RStudio**

1. Open RStudio and select `File -> New Project`

2. Select `New Directory`

3. Select `New Project`

4. Enter directory name and location

5. **Select `Create a git repository`**


**From cmd/terminal**
1. Open command line or terminal

2. `cd` into a directory where you want project to be housed

3. Create folder for project `mkdir [folder-name]`

4. `cd` into new directory 

5. Initialize repository `git init`
