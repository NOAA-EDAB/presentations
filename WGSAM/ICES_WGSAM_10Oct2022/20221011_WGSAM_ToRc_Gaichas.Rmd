"Both our model predictions and the observations reside in a halo of uncertainty and the true state of the system is assumed to be unknown, but lie within the observational uncertainty (Fig. 1a). A model starts to have skill when the observational and predictive uncertainty halos overlap, in the ideal case the halos overlap completely (Fig. 1b). Thus, skill assessment requires a set of quantitative metrics and procedures for comparing model output with observational data in a manner appropriate to the particular application."

## Skill assessment with ecological interactions... fit criteria alone are not sufficient
*Ignore predation at your peril: results from multispecies state-space modeling  *  [Trijoulet et al. 2020](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13515)
>Ignoring trophic interactions that occur in marine ecosystems induces bias in stock assessment outputs and results in low model predictive ability with subsequently biased reference points.

EM1: multispecies state space 

EM2: multispecies, no process error 

EM3: single sp. state space, constant M 

EM4: single sp. state space, age-varying M

This is an important paper both because it demonstrates the importance of addressing strong species interactions, and it shows that measures of fit do not indicate good model predictive performance. Ignoring process error caused bias, but much smaller than ignoring species interactions.

## Difficulties so far
.pull-left-60[
Atlantis related

*  Understanding Atlantis outputs (much improved with documentation since 2015)
*  Reconciling different Atlantis outputs, which to use?
*  Calculations correct? attempted M, per capita consumption
    
Skill assessment related

*  Running stock assessment models is difficult to automate. A lot of decisions are made by iterative running and diagnostic checks.
*  Generating input parameters for models that are consistent with Atlantis can be time consuming (Atlantis is a little too realistic...)
    + Fit vonB length at age models to atlantisom output for input to length based model, not all converge (!)
    + What is M (see above)

    + `atlantisom` is using outputs not often used in other applications
    + I don't run Atlantis so putting print statements in code not an option
    + could be more efficient with targeted group work

    + should we expect numbers in one output to match those in others?
    + diet comp from detailed file matches diet comp in simpler output
    + catch in numbers not always matching between standard and annual age outputs
    + YOY output
    + ... others that have been encountered

    + estimating per capita consumption from detaileddiet.txt results in lower numbers than expected
    + still can't get reasonable mortality estimates from outputs--understand this is an issue
