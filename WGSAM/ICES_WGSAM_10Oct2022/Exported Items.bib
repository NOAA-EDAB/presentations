	abstract = {There is increasing consensus of the need for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), which accounts for trophic interactions and environmental conditions when managing exploited marine resources. Continued development and testing of analytical tools that are expected to address EBFM needs are essential for guiding the management of fisheries resources in achieving and balancing multiple social, economic, and conservation objectives. To address these needs, we present and compare alternative climate-informed multi-species statistical catch-at-age models to account for spatio-temporal differences in stock distributions, with application to four groundfish species (walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, and Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Gulf of Alaska, USA. We integrate across multiple forms of uncertainty regarding the data and distribution of Pacific halibut using an ensemble modelling approach. Models developed here can be used to supplement current tactical fisheries management and inform on the trade-offs between harvesting across groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska. This approach may be applicable for other situations where spatial and temporal overlap is extensive among closely coupled species.},
