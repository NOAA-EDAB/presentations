K Holsman: Hoping to deploy that model for the Bering operationally now that its published (and phase out ADMB version we've used operationally since 2016 as the an appendix to the pollock assessment).

Bering Sea ACLIM climate simulations, including multispecies reference points, harvest control rules, and tradeoffs against the global OY cap
???
Andy's paper of Bering ACLIM climate simulations, that includes multispecies reference points, harvest control rules, and tradeoffs against the global OY cap:  https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.624301/full.  Maybe just a bullet to say that we're using models with those features works?  Stops short of a full MSE (according to Andre) because we didn't include adaptive assessment/observation error.

Jon Reum has been developing a protocol for multimodal ensemble projections that include Ceattle, Rpath, and Mizer (recent workshop work, no figures/results yet).

 (to my knowledge) is the first to link prey abundance to growth of predators in one of these models since Gislason 1999

## [Rpath](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/Rpath) for the Mid-Atlantic: Climate driven predator migration shifts

.pull-left[
**Brandon Beltz MS thesis** 

*  Built Mid Atlantic Rpath
*  Forced migration of spiny dogfish and other sharks
*  Changed amount leaving the system (Range shift)
*  Changed timing of migration (Phenological shift)
*  Simulated individually, and combined Range and Phenological shift
*  Evaluated food web impacts
