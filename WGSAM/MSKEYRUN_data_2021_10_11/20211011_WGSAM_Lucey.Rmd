# Georges Bank Multispecies Keyrun Project 

.pull-left[
- New England Fisheries Management Council (NEFMC) is considering a shift to place-base, ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM)
- Example Fisheries Ecosystem Plan (eFEP) will focus on the Georges Bank Ecological Production Unit (EPU)
- NEFMC's EBFM Plan Development Team proposed a management procedure using ceilings and floors
- An implementation of this procedure using the Hydra model was reviewed by the Center of Independent Experts in 2018

# Georges Bank Multispecies Keyrun Project 

.pull-left[

- Several concerns remained
    - What happens with all the species in the region under proposed management regime?
    - How well do multispecies models perform for assessment?
    - How does this compare to what we are currently doing?

Georges Bank MSKEYRUN project designed to address the first two concerns

Develop potential operating models for a management strategy evaluation (MSE) that could be used to address the third

# Motivation for a common data set

.pull-left[
- Objectives will require the development (refinement) of several multispecies/ecosystem models
- **LOTS** of data to sift through/ decisions to be made
- Time spent organizing data is magnified when dealing with multiple species
- Need to generalize solutions to common data issues
- Did **NOT** want multiple versions of starting parameters

# Creating a reproducible workflow

.pull-left[
- Lots of decision points
    - Spatial domain
    - Temporal domain
    - Focal species
- Easy to forget why or even what decisions were made
- Create a repository to document decisions
- Tracked progress with a kanban board software

Fisheries independent data resides on the survey database schema (SVDBS) while fisheries dependent data is split between the commercial fisheries and observer databases

# Creating R Packages to pull/manipulate data

- Turned older R scripts into packages
- Focused on making more accessible with consistent data outputs
- Survey data - [Survdat](https://noaa-edab.github.io/survdat/)
- Commercial landings and discards - [Comlandr](https://noaa-edab.github.io/comlandr/)
- Commercial length data - [MSCatch](https://noaa-edab.github.io/mscatch/index.html)

# Creating a data repository

- Some experience with [Ecodata](https://noaa-edab.github.io/ecodata/landing_page) for our State of the Ecosystem Reports
- Converted documentation repository into data repository
- Data and documentation in one place ([MSKeyrun](https://noaa-edab.github.io/ms-keyrun/))
