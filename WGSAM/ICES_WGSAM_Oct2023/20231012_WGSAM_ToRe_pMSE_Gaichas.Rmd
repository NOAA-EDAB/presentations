# EBFM "prototype" MSE in New England

## Overview

Goal: Demonstrate how MSE can be used to evaluate EBFM management strategies for a Georges Bank Ecosystem Production Unit.

Process:
*  Worked iteratively with management committee and advisors as stakeholders 
*  Combined existing tools to evaluate EBFM procedures: Link multispecies model to MSE framework with built in single species assessment tools

Fundamental objectives:
*  Maintain or increase inflation adjusted total value for the fishery
*  Preserve ecosystem function and structure
*  Maintain stock complex biomass around levels that optimize fishing opportunities 
*  Prevent overfishing
*  Response of regulations to stocks at low abundance, and recovery of depleted stocks
*  Reduce regulatory complexity

Hydra: multispecies operating model conditioned on Georges Bank data within MSE framework as prototype test of EBFM strategies. 

Results: additional flexibility and increased yield possible with EBFM "ceilings and floors" without increased risk to single stocks.

## Operating Model Scenarios

*  Base
*  Fleet dynamics (Adjust q for economic value)
*  Initial biomass (Below base)
*  Predator pressure (Increase M1 <30cm)
*  Prey change (Increase other food)

# Key takeaways

*  Stock complex management resulted in higher and less variable catches (results below are for the trophic based complexes).
*  Higher catches did not come at the expense of stock conservation status
*  Catch closer to catch advice under stock complex management
*  Results similar for different operating model initial condition scenarios: 

red: high B, brown: high predators, green: high prey, blue: low B, purple: $F

???
Increased Predator Pressure (higher M1 on forage)
*  More variable total annual catches
*  Higher under-used quota
*  Lower catches
Increased Prey availability (more other food for modeled predators)
*  All the above, plus fewer stocks below limits
Price-based fleet dynamics (higher relative catchability on more valuable stocks)
*  More stocks below limits

# Relative performance of management alternatives
Points closer to the exterior edge indicate a better performance for the metric than points closer to the center.

*  Stock complex management generally out preformed single species based management.
*  Gear based complexes resulted in higher variability and more underutilized quota than the trophic based complexes.
