Albi Rovellini's ongoing work on evaluating GOA optimum yield with Atlantis. This is part of a study on multispecies fishing simulations under different climate regimes and fishing configurations. 

*  Gulf of Alaska groundfish is managed with a multispecies ecosystem cap on annual catch allocations
*  Optimum Yield cap = 800,000 mt each year, sum of single-species ABC must be lower
*  Similar system in the Bering Sea, but higher cap (2M t)
*  Since 1987, the GOA OY cap has never constrained catch allocations (unlike the Bering Sea cap), suggesting that the OY cap may be too high for the productivity of GOA stocks
*  Given its history and projected climate change in the GOA, should we expect the OY cap to constrain GOA catches in the future?
*  Multispecies fishing simulations with Atlantis, 4 climate-fishing combinations:
*  Fishing: (1) all stocks fished at equal multipliers of FMSY; (2) same as (1) except arrowtooth flounder is only lightly exploited
*  Climate: from ROMS, (1) pre-heatwave 1999 cool conditions; (2) high CO2 emissions, end of century scenario

Results:
Underexploitation of key groundfish predator Arrowtooth flounder (right-hand column) leads to lower global yield, because arrowtooth predates on groundfish (mostly walleye pollock). Arrowtooth flounder is currently lightly exploited because it has limited commercial value
Warmer climate (bottom row) leads to lower global yield, largely because of near collapse of Pacific cod under warm conditions mediated by recruitment failure

TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The OY cap in the GOA is unlikely to constrain fishery allocations in the future

CEATTLE, developed by Kirstin Holsman at the Alaska Center, is a multispecies statistical catch-at-age assessment model that includes ecosystem considerations like bioenergetics and multispecies interactions (Holsman et al. applications in AK) or, in this case, multiple life-stage interactions.

Sophia Wassermann and colleagues have applied the model to study how temperature variability and cannibalism in Pacific hake interact to influence stock productivity. Adding cannibalism to the model leads to higher estimated recruitment and biomass, due to the inclusion of predation mortality, largely on age-1 hake. 

This work is expected to be relevant to other highly cannibalistic hake stocks; additionally the NWFSC team welcomes input and advice from other examples where cannibalism has been included in assessments, such as for Northeast Arctic Cod.

We conducted a management strategy evaluation to assess the robustness of current and alternative Pacific sardine harvest control rules under a variety of recruitment scenarios representing potential projections of future climate conditions in the California Current. The current environmentally  informed control rule modifies the harvest rate for the northern sardine subpopulation based on average sea surface temperatures measured during California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries 24 Investigations (CalCOFI) field cruises. This rule prioritizes catch at intermediate biomass levels but may increase variability in catch and closure frequency compared to alternative control rules, especially if recruitment is unrelated to ocean temperatures. Fishing at maximum sustainable yield and using dynamically estimated reference points reduced the frequency of biomass falling below 150,000 mt by up to 17%, while using survey index-based biomass estimates resulted in a 29 14% higher risk of delayed fishery closure during stock declines than when using assessment based estimates.

VAST model-based "forage index" aggregating 20 prey groups using stomach contents of 22 predators: Gaichas et al in press, http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2023-0093
]

???
<font size="-1"></font>

Changing distribution and abundance of small pelagics may drive changes in predator distributions, affecting predator availability to fisheries and surveys. However, small pelagic fish are difficult to survey directly, so we developed a novel method of assessing small pelagic fish aggregate abundance via predator diet data. We used piscivore diet data collected from multiple bottom trawl surveys within a Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) model to assess trends of small pelagics on the Northeast US shelf. The goal was to develop a spatial “forage index” to inform survey and/or fishery availability in the bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) stock assessment. Using spring and fall surveys from 1973-2020, 20 small pelagic groups were identified as major bluefish prey using the diet data. Then, predators were grouped by diet similarity to identify 19 piscivore species with the most similar diet to bluefish in the region. Diets from all 20 piscivores were combined for the 20 prey groups at each surveyed location, and the total weight of small pelagic prey per predator stomach at each location was input into a Poisson-link delta model to estimate expected prey mass per predator stomach. Best fit models included spatial and spatio-temporal random effects, with predator mean length, number of predator species, and sea surface temperature as catchability covariates. Spring and fall prey indices were split into inshore and offshore areas to reflect changing prey availability over time in areas available to the recreational fishery and the bottom trawl survey, and also to contribute to regional ecosystem reporting

Using NEFSC bottom trawl survey diet data from 1973-2021, 20 small pelagic groups were identified as major bluefish prey with 10 or more observations (in descending order of observations): Longfin squids (*Doryteuthis* formerly *Loligo* sp.), Anchovy family (Engraulidae), bay anchovy (*Anchoa mitchilli*), Atlantic butterfish, (*Peprilus triachanthus*), Cephalopoda, (*Anchoa hepsetus*), red eye round herring (*Etrumeus teres*), Sandlance (*Ammodytes* sp.), scup (*Stenotomus chrysops*), silver hake (*Merluccius bilinearis*), shortfin squids (*Illex* sp.), Atlantic herring (*Clupea harengus*), Herring family (Clupeidae), Bluefish (*Pomatomus saltatrix*), silver anchovy (*Engraulis eurystole*), longfin inshore squid (*Doryteuthis pealeii*), Atlantic mackerel (*Scomber scombrus*), flatfish (Pleuronectiformes), weakfish (*Cynoscion regalis*), and Atlantic menhaden (*Brevoortia tyrannus*). 

Prey categories such as fish unidentified, Osteichthyes, and unidentified animal remains were not included in the prey list. Although unidentified fish and Osteichthyes can comprise a significant portion of bluefish stomach contents, we cannot assume that unidentified fish in other predator stomachs represent unidentified fish in bluefish stomachs.

Application of the forage fish index to the recreational catch per angler catchability was successful when implemented as an autoregressive process over the time-series with WHAM estimating the standard error, and led to an overall decreasing trend in catchability over time.

WHAM is a state space stock assessment model framework: https://timjmiller.github.io/wham/

The Bigelow index fit with the fall forage fish index did not improve the model fit (AIC), was slightly worse fit and gave identical results
The Albatross index fit with the fall forage fish index did not converge or hessian was not positive definite for any of the models (even when how = 0 for some of them).
The MRIP index fit with the annual forage fish index did not converge or hessian was not positive definite for any of the models
